[{"content":" What may I give to the Lord for all the good things that he has done for me? I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord. I will make the offering of my oath to the Lord, even before all his people. -Psalm 116:12-14 (Basic English translation)\nAs I watch my students eat lunch in the high school cafeteria, I sadly witness a great deal of waste. It would not be unusual for a boy to pull out an apple his mother packed for him, take a bite or two out of it, and throw the rest away. It brings to mind a story of an American missionary moving to a poor part of Central America. She brought an apple on the flight, but never got around to eating it. That afternoon, while unpacking in her new home, a neighborhood girl noticed the big beautiful apple in her bag. The missionary realized that the little girl was fascinated by the apple, so she gave it to her. The girl reverently held the apple in both of her hands and slowly walked out of the room, never taking her wonder-filled eyes off her gift. The missionary presumed that the girl went off somewhere to eat it, but she found out later that the girl took it back home, diced it, and walked around the impoverished neighborhood, giving everyone a taste of this rare and precious gift.\nGratitude is the key to a virtuous life. Conversely, all sin boils down to ingratitude to an abuse or neglect of God\u0026rsquo;s gifts. If I live in gratitude for some particular gift God has given me if I uphold it as a sacred object to be treated with reverence then I will not misuse that gift. A great deal of my prayer life, then, should be that of thanking and praising God for his many gifts. I might even want to zero in on the gifts I have abused lately and praise God for them especially. For example, if I am routinely hard on my spouse, this problem might be an indication that I am not appreciating the gift he has been in my life. The more I nurture and develop a habit of thanking God for the gift of my husband, the less inclined I will be to abuse him with my words and actions. If my sin is overeating, then, chances are, I need to praise God for the sacred vessel of my own body. My gratitude will lead me to do all that I can to keep this great gift in mint condition.\nMany times Christians slip into a Pelagian mindset wherein we believe that we have to earn our way into heaven. Fear of eternal damnation, then, becomes my motivation to live virtuously. But Jesus, through the Gospels and through church teaching, tells us that heaven is a free gift from God. We could never possibly earn such a gift-it must come free of charge. If we have truly accepted this unearned salvation, then we live our Christian lives not out of fear but as a grateful response to God\u0026rsquo;s unconditional love. How much holier would our lives be if we lived in gratitude to God rather than in fear of him?\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES 1 SAMUEL 2:1-10: Hannah\u0026rsquo;s song\nPSALM 104: Praise the Lord, O my soul\nPSALM 116: What return shall I make for the good he has done for me?\nPSALM 118: You are my God, I will give thanks to you; I will extol you\nPSALM 149:1-5: Praise his name with dancing, making melody to him\nDANIEL 3:52-90: All things bless the Lord\nLUKE 1:26-56: Mary\u0026rsquo;s song of gratitude\nLUKE 7:36-50: The forgiven woman\nLUKE 17:11-19: The grateful leper\n1 CORINTHIANS 1:4-9: You are enriched in every way\n2 CORINTHIANS 9:6-15: God loves a cheerful giver\nPHILIPPIANS 1:3-26: Paul is grateful for his imprisonment\nPHILIPPIANS 4:4-13: Rejoice in the Lord, always\nCOLOSSIANS 3:12-17: Give thanks to God\nREVELATION 19:5-9: Alleluia!

Is it out of obligation? Fear of God? Or is it grateful response to God\u0026rsquo;s goodness?\nI reflect on Psalm 116. I prayerfully consider what would be a grateful response to God for all the good that God has given me. If I feel called to do so, I make a vow to God to respond to his love in some particular and concrete way.\nRELATED ENTRIES Awe, Content, Evening, Joyful, Proud, Can\u0026rsquo;t Wait\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Life is a banquet, and most of the poor fools of the world are starving.\n-Auntie Mame (paraphrased)\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/20.-god-im-grateful/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat may I give to the Lord for all the good things that he has done for me?

As many as seven times?\u0026rdquo; Jesus said to him, \u0026ldquo;Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times. -Matthew 18:21-22\nThere are two types of forgiveness: forgiveness of the will and forgiveness of the heart. Forgiveness of the will is the choice to do all in my power, regardless of how I feel, to preserve and enhance the well-being of my offender. The all in my power part is important. Perhaps my anger will not yet allow me even to speak to my offender. Or perhaps I have discerned that it is not God\u0026rsquo;s will that I be in relationship with this person at this time (for example, a battered wife might discern that it is not God\u0026rsquo;s will for her to be with her husband anymore). Insofar as it is in my power to choose to forgive, I must forgive. That is what Christ teaches me to do. The choice part of that definition is important, too. Forgiveness of the will is a conscious choice that I make based on what I believe is God\u0026rsquo;s will for me.\nForgiveness of the heart is a different matter. For the most part, I cannot will to experience one emotion or another. I cannot choose to feel affection for another or not to feel anger, betrayal or hurt. It simply is not in my power to do so. No, I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to pray for and wait for that gift to come from God. My choice to forgive with my will opens me up to receive the gift of forgiveness of the heart, but the gift itself must come from God.\nI remember well my greatest experience of hurt and betrayal. It took me forever to get over it! It was in my daily prayer time that the Lord gradually bestowed the gift of forgiveness in my heart. Adapting the insights from a particular style of psychological therapy called Gestalt, I prayed in my chair with two other chairs in front of me. I sat Jesus in one of those chairs and my offender in the other. With Jesus present, I would say anything that I wanted to my offender. I might yell at him or curse him or tell him all sorts of despicable things. But at the end of my prayer time, I allowed both of my two guests to speak to me as well. At the end of our conversation, regardless of whether my heart felt it or not, I told my offender, \u0026ldquo;You hurt me, but I forgive you and I love you.\u0026rdquo; And one beautiful sunny morning, I said it and realized that there was no part of me that didn\u0026rsquo;t genuinely mean it, not even my heart!\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 45:1-15: Joseph forgives his brothers\n1 SAMUEL 24: David forgives Saul\nEZEKIEL 37:1-14: God revives dry bones\nJONAH 4: Jonah\u0026rsquo;s anger at the Lord\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness\nMATTHEW 5:38-48: Do not retaliate; love your enemies\nMATTHEW 7:1-5: Don\u0026rsquo;t judge others\nMATTHEW 18:15-20: If you have a problem with someone\nMATTHEW 18:21-35: Forgive seventy-seven times\nMARK 11:23-26: Forgive anyone\nLUKE 5:17-26: Jesus: \u0026ldquo;Your sins are forgiven\u0026rdquo;\nLUKE 6:27-36: When someone slaps you on the one cheek\nLUKE 15:11-32: The Prodigal Son\nLUKE 19:1-10: Come down, Zacchaeus\nLUKE 23:33-38: Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do\nLUKE 23:39-43: Jesus saves the good thief\nJOHN 21:15-17: Jesus forgives Peter\nEPHESIANS 4:25-32: The sun must not go down on your wrath\nPRAYER POINTERS First, I work on forgiveness as an act of the will. With God I lay down exactly what I must do and must not do in order to be loving to my offender. I pay particular attention to the ways I may lash back in a passive-aggressive manner. That is, ways that I may deviously, unconsciously and subtly jab back at the offender: a well-placed comment to mutual friends, an avoidance of mutual responsibility, a \u0026ldquo;harmless joke\u0026rdquo; about her and so on. I ask God to help me avoid these sinful actions. With each future action that I contemplate, I ask Jesus to help me discern my motives. \u0026ldquo;Am I doing this out of love or revenge?\u0026rdquo; I also look back on the previous day, evaluating each of my words and actions in the same way.\nI sit in my prayer chair with two other chairs in front of me. I place Jesus in one and my offender in the other. Then, I let the sparks fly, allowing all three of us to have some say. After we\u0026rsquo;ve all had our say, whether I feel it yet or not, I turn to my offender and say, \u0026ldquo;You hurt me, but I forgive you, and I love you.\u0026rdquo;\nI reflect on a time when I was forgiven by someone.

God, I Just Can't Forgive"},{"content":" When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, \u0026ldquo;He has lost his senses.\u0026rdquo; -Mark 3:21 (NASB)\nThere are a variety of reasons why my family (which in my case is a religious community) might be driving me nuts. One reason may be that home is the only safe place for me to go nuts. That is, I know that they will accept me even if I do fly off the handle from time to time. In many ways, I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed to \u0026ldquo;lose it\u0026rdquo; at work, in church or among friends. I may fear rejection from the people in those circles. So, I take my pent-up aggravation and anger home to the one place I know I can release it and still be loved and accepted. Meanwhile, my family members are doing the same with me.\nIdeally, family members shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to have misplaced anger, irritation and frustration dumped on them. I should work toward channeling those negative feelings in more healthy ways. I should ask the Lord to help me reflect on my own attitudes and behaviors at home. Do I always leave \u0026ldquo;the emotional leftovers\u0026rdquo; for my family? In other words, do I give my best self, my highest quality time, my most thoughtful words and actions, and my most compassionate dispositions to everyone else in my life and save whatever is left over for my family? How could I be more generous to my family in terms of quality time, emotional support and presence of mind and heart? In the meantime, while I struggle to be more generous at home, I should thank God that I have a family that allows me to dump on them, and I should pray for the strength of character to create a safe place where they might dump on me as well.\nAnother reason for my frustration with the family might be that I expect more from them than they can actually give me. A teenager, whose father had more or less abandoned him, told me once, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that I need to go out and find my own father-figures.\u0026rdquo; He then proceeded to name a variety of adults in his life on whom he relies for paternal nurturing, care and support. Over the years I have come to appreciate this idea as a profound one. No matter how great are our family members, we all need to go out and find a variety of mother-figures, father-figures, brother-figures, sister-figures and even son-figures and daughter-figures. Maybe the reason my family is driving me nuts is that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly fill the expansive role I expect from them. Maybe, for example, even as an adult, the mothering that I need couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be filled by one person. I may need lots of mothers in my life. If I find a variety of moms to fill the needs I have, then maybe I could accept my biological mother for who she is and not resent her for who she is not.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 4:1-16: Cain and Abel\nGENESIS 33:1-11: Jacob and Esau reconcile\nGENESIS 45:1-15: Joseph forgives his brothers\nRUTH 1:1-18: Ruth is loyal to her mother-in-law\nSIRACH 3: Honor your father, that his blessing may come upon you\nMATTHEW 20:20-28: Mother pleads for James and John\nMARK 9:33-37: Disciples: \u0026ldquo;Who is the greatest?\u0026rdquo;\nLUKE 2:41-52: Finding the boy Jesus in the Temple\nLUKE 8:19-21: Who are my brothers and sisters?\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha and Mary\nJOHN 13:1-20: Jesus washes his disciples\u0026rsquo; feet\nEPHESIANS 6:1-4: Children, obey your parents\nPRAYER POINTERS I explore the possibility that I may be taking out pent-up negative emotions on my family. What are those negative emotions? What am I really angry, sad or confused about? I ask God to help me figure out how to deal directly with these problems rather than taking them out on my family.\nI prayerfully explore how I might spend more quality time with my family. Or if I cannot spend more time, then how might I better use the time we do have together?\nIf a family member has been particularly ornery lately, I ask the Lord to help me see things through the eyes of that person. What is going on in her life right now? What battles is she fighting inside of her? How might I help the situation? What things do I do that only exacerbate the problem? What grace (for example, strength, patience, hope, courage) does she need in her life right now? I pray in petition for her to receive the graces she needs.\nI prayerfully explore if I might have unrealistic expectations of a particular family member. If I have certain emotional or psychological needs that cannot be met by my spouse, brother, mother, etc., how might I healthily get these needs met elsewhere? What nonbiological family members (for example, friends, coworkers, ministers and so on) might I rely on for help in these areas of need?\nI ask the Lord to show me ways I might be more generous toward members of my family, particularly the ones that are driving me crazy right now.

I remember thinking to myself, \u0026ldquo;This is what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be like: the young deacon reciting the words of the Breviary for his dying pastor and mentor. This is the kind of life and death I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted for myself. It\u0026rsquo;s what I prayed for as a novice.\u0026rdquo;\nI kept trying to turn off my emotions as I read. I knew that Harry needed me to be strong just then, so I kept choking back the tears and read on:\nLord, make haste and answer;\nFor my spirit fails within me.\nDo not hide your face\nLest I become like those in the grave.\nMy efforts failed. I had to stop reading because my crying was taking over. I was angry with myself for ruining this important moment for Harry, but then I looked back at him and noticed that he had fallen into a peaceful sleep.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES DEUTERONOMY 34: When Moses dies\n1 KINGS 2:1-11: When David dies\n2 KINGS 2:1-15: Elijah in the whirlwind\nPSALM 23: Though I walk through the shadow of death\nISAIAH 35:1-10: A song of hope\nISAIAH 40:1-11: Every valley shall be lifted up; every hill will be made low\nLUKE 11:5-13: Ask and you shall receive; knock and it shall be opened\nLUKE 22:39-46: Father, if it is your will, take this cup from me\nLUKE 23:26-31: Weeping women\nLUKE 23:44-49: The death of Jesus\nJOHN 6:22-58: I am the bread of life\nJOHN 10:11-18: I am the good shepherd\nJOHN 11:1-44: Lazarus\u0026rsquo;s death\nJOHN 14:1-3: In my Father\u0026rsquo;s house there are many dwelling places\nROMANS 8: Sufferings of the present are nothing compared to glory\n2 CORINTHIANS 4:1-5:10: We carry in our bodies the dying of Jesus\nCOLOSSIANS 1:22-29: In my flesh I fill up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ\n2 TIMOTHY 4:6-8: I have run the good race\u0026hellip;my crown awaits\n1 PETER 1:3-9: You may have to suffer for a time\nPRAYER POINTERS I may find any sort of meditation, contemplation or prayer that requires concentration and stillness too difficult right now. My situation may be simply too emotionally tumultuous for me to settle myself. In that case, I may find ready-made prayer (for example: the rosary, written prayers from a prayer book, or the Liturgy of the Hours) more helpful. This type of prayer requires little concentration on my part, so if my mind or emotions begin to wander, the prayers themselves will take me back.\nIf prayer is difficult for the loved ones of the dying, it is often even more so in the experience of the dying persons themselves. Many prayerful people expect to have powerful experiences in prayer near the end of their lives and are disappointed when, because of medication or other factors, they can hardly pray at all. If I feel called to it, I might want to ask my dying friend if she wants to pray together. Very often, even not so religious people long to pray but are too bashful or afraid to ask for help. If she is interested, I could pray simple prayers such as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer or the Hail Mary. She may be able to pray aloud with me, but even if she can\u0026rsquo;t, she could mentally follow along. Within myself, I often feel humbled and grateful for the privilege of praying in place of someone unable to do so. If she really enjoys praying together, I may want to establish some sort of ritual, such as praying the rosary with her every night before she sleeps.\nPerhaps my most important prayer at this time is simply the prayer of silent presence. That is, the long periods of time I sit quietly by her bedside while she sleeps or rests. In my own experience, I have found this to be a profound experience of prayer. I can sense God\u0026rsquo;s presence in the room as I lovingly wait by the bedside. Often at these times I am struck with awe at the wonder of God\u0026rsquo;s gift of life, and I might even have the gift of gratitude for the whole cycle of life, death and resurrection to which we are all called.\nRELATED ENTRIES Afraid, Angry at You, Change, Grieving, Nighttime, Sad\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Now that I have found the joy of utilizing all forms of growth to make you, or to let you, grow in me, grant that I may willingly consent to this last phase of communion in the course of which I shall possess you by diminishing in you.

From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him. We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. -Isaiah 64:1, 3-4, 6-7\nMany people have the mistaken notion that those who have a strong prayer life never have problems experiencing God\u0026rsquo;s presence in prayer. But any long-term pray-er will tell you that it is not unusual to go through long periods without feeling anything at all in one\u0026rsquo;s prayer. Thérèse of Lisieux, John of the Cross, Ignatius Loyola, Teresa of Avila all of the great mystics of the church have spoken of the common experience of dryness in one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual life. Mystics of our day have said the same. Henri Nouwen, one of the most important spiritual writers of our time, once said, \u0026ldquo;[My prayer time is not a time]\u0026hellip;of deep prayer, nor a time in which I experience a special closeness to God; it is not a period of serious attentiveness to the divine mysteries. I wish it were! On the contrary, it is full of distractions, inner restlessness, sleepiness, confusion, and boredom. It seldom, if ever, pleases my senses.\u0026rdquo; And Mother Teresa of Calcutta, not long before her death, was asked, \u0026ldquo;How does it feel to be so close to God?\u0026rdquo; She answered, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been so long since I\u0026rsquo;ve felt close to God that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what it feels like.\u0026rdquo; One who is spiritually dry should take comfort from such auspicious company. While our faith tells us that God is always present, the experience of the church tells us that, for whatever reason, God sometimes allows us to go through periods in which we do not feel his presence.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s even worse than that: sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t even feel the desire to feel God\u0026rsquo;s presence. This experience can embarrass us, and we often deny it. I remember once going through such a period in my spiritual life. My spiritual director sensed it and asked, \u0026ldquo;Mark, do you desire to be closer to God right now?\u0026rdquo; I nervously said, \u0026ldquo;Well, of course I do!\u0026rdquo; and chattered away about some pious notion that was unrelated to the topic. The director let me talk a moment and then asked again, \u0026ldquo;Mark, do you desire to be closer to God?\u0026rdquo; Again I deflected the question. But the third time she asked, my shoulders slumped and I fell back into the chair, defeated. Staring up at the ceiling, I confessed, \u0026ldquo;No. Right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to be with God.\u0026rdquo; She smiled and said, \u0026ldquo;Now we\u0026rsquo;re getting somewhere!\u0026rdquo; We spent the rest of the conversation talking about what to do with this mood. She reminded me of Saint Ignatius\u0026rsquo;s advice, that when I don\u0026rsquo;t feel God\u0026rsquo;s presence, I need to pray at least for the desire of God\u0026rsquo;s presence. With great compassion, Ignatius advised further that if I can\u0026rsquo;t even do that, then perhaps I could pray for the desire for the desire. Now that\u0026rsquo;s a prayer I can always handle.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES JUDITH 8:25-27: Not for vengeance did the Lord test them\nJOB 6-7: Job is angry with God\nPSALM 22: My God, why have you forsaken me?\nPSALM 63:1-9: All through the night I will meditate on you\nPSALM 77: Will God spurn us forever, and never again be favorable?\nPSALM 102: I am withered, dried up like the grass\nPSALM 143:6-7: My soul thirsts for you\nISAIAH 43:14-21: See, I am doing something new\nISAIAH 63:15-19: Look down from heaven, O Lord\nISAIAH 64: O, that you would tear open the heavens and come down!\nMATTHEW 7:7-11: Seek and you shall find\nMARK 4:35-41: Jesus sleeping in the boat\nMARK 15:33-34: My God, why have you forsaken me?\nLUKE 11:5-13: If one keeps knocking, the master arises\nJAMES 5:7-11: Wait for Christ\u0026rsquo;s coming\nPRAYER POINTERS While waiting for my prayer life to pick up, I can always go back to easier forms of prayer that do not require me to focus as well. I can pray the rosary, the Liturgy of the Hours or I can use some ready-made prayer book that has worked for me in the past.\nI prayerfully evaluate the logistics of my prayer times. Do I pray at a bad time of day? Do I use the best prayer posture (that is, a position that is relaxed and yet keeps me awake)? Am I giving myself enough time to pray? Have I done what I could to rid myself of distractions? Do I seek the advice of a spiritual director or mentor?\nI prayerfully ask myself if there is some unacknowledged problem between God and me. Am I angry with God about something? Do I have a fear that I have not yet faced?\nI prayerfully return to a time when prayer was going well. What was I praying about then? What Bible passage was I using? What prayer approach? I return to whatever it was that worked back then.\nI look back through the past day and ask myself: where was God present to me? Who wore God\u0026rsquo;s face today? I prayerfully return to that moment of my day and praise God for it. I consider how I might respond to such love.\nAs always, it is important that I tell God what I desire. If I desire to feel his presence, I must prayerfully beg God to give me such an experience. If I don\u0026rsquo;t even have that desire, then I should pray for that desire to come to me.\nI slowly read Mark 4:35-41. In my imagination I notice that, though the boat ride is rough because of the ensuing storm, Jesus is so tired that he just can\u0026rsquo;t keep his eyes open anymore. So I go over to him and say, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s OK, Lord. I will sit by your side as you sleep.\u0026rdquo; I make that statement my mantra, repeating it over and over again. I try to imagine myself sitting by the side of Jesus as he sleeps. Though my spiritual storm grows more furious, I am not concerned. Instead, I look with love on my friend and Lord, keeping still so as not to wake him.\nAt the end of my prayer time, I tell God how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling about our relationship at this time. I let him know if I feel frustrated, angry, confused and so on. As best I can, I close with a prayer of surrender, something like this: \u0026ldquo;God, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why you\u0026rsquo;re allowing me to feel distant from you right now, but I trust that you will always do what is best for me. So I place my prayer life in your hands, and I accept whatever it is you wish to do with it. If you call me into the desert, I willingly accept your call.

Let go of the branch.\u0026rdquo; The man thought about it a minute, looked down into the deep ravine and then back up into the heavens and yelled, \u0026ldquo;Is there anybody else up there?\u0026rdquo;\nWhen I was a kid, my teenaged brother, Greg, would sometimes interrupt my all-important TV watching with \u0026ldquo;Come on. I need you to help me start the truck.\u0026rdquo; I begrudgingly went outside and found my place in the lineup between other brothers and/or neighbors at the back of Greg\u0026rsquo;s 1969 Ford pickup. The bunch of us would push it as fast as possible down our quiet little street while Greg kept turning the ignition and pumping the gas. Eventually, the little truck would remember how to do this on its own, and off he went.\nThis little trick of getting a running start has proven useful in other areas of life. If I lose my train of thought while giving a speech, I can often just keep talking a minute or two and my brain will \u0026ldquo;kick in\u0026rdquo; again. If I get stuck during my writing, I just keep going, writing gibberish if I have to. Eventually, my fingers will find the right keys again. I have a feeling this little trick works for big stuff, too. I\u0026rsquo;ll bet married people use this trick to get through the rough spots. They just keep going in the direction they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to go until it feels right and natural again.\nSaint Ignatius Loyola advises that if I\u0026rsquo;m having problems believing or if I know in my head the right thing to do but my heart is resisting, then I should act as if I do believe, as if my heart were fully amenable until I do, in fact, believe again with my whole heart and soul. Oftentimes, when my faith wavers, I take great consolation in this advice. First, it reminds me that doubting is a common phenomenon and not necessarily a sin. Second, it tells me what I should do while waiting for my feeble faith to return. I act as if. I go through the motions, not as a hypocrite but as one who has allowed his will to push him through when his heart is acting fickle. This is why the church values ritual so much. It allows my body and my voice to move me through the barren deserts of my spiritual life. Eventually, my heart and soul will kick in again. I just have to be patient. And from pushing my brother\u0026rsquo;s truck, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned also that I might need to grab some friends and family to help push me down the road a bit until I can do it on my own again.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 18:1-15: Sarah laughs, doubting God\u0026rsquo;s promise\nMATTHEW 17:14-21: If you had the faith of a mustard seed\nMARK 5:21-42: Jesus heals a woman and raises a dead girl\nMARK 9:14-29: I do believe; help my unbelief\nJOHN 20:19-29: Doubting Thomas\n1 CORINTHIANS 1:18-25: Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom\n1 CORINTHIANS 2:6-16: Eyes have not seen; ears have not heard\nHEBREWS 11:1-3: Faith is the assurance of things hoped for\nJAMES 1:2-7: The testing of your faith produces endurance\nPRAYER POINTERS In most cases doubting is not a sin, since it usually wells up without my choosing it. When I have doubts it is important to face them honestly rather than pretend they don\u0026rsquo;t exist. Most importantly, I need to bring those doubts to God. I need to tell God that my faith in him is not so strong. Since Saint Ignatius insists that we always tell God what we need, I must tell God that I need to feel his presence or witness his action in the world in a more concrete way. If I need to, I\u0026rsquo;ll even shake my fist at him as Job, Jonah and many others did. I may chide him for abandoning me as Jesus did. I know in my head, of course, that God never abandons me, but in my heart I\u0026rsquo;m feeling this way and I must let God know that.\nWhen my soul is faltering, I allow my body and my will to do the heavy lifting. I turn to more ritualistic prayers. I tell God that my body will have to pray for me (through kneeling and standing at Mass, for example) while my heart and soul are wavering.\nIn prayer I come up with a few people to whom I can go with this problem. I need loved ones to carry me through this time. In Mark 5:25-34 the hemorrhaging woman was healed merely through touching the tassel of Jesus. Spiritual writer Ronald Rolheiser says that when my faith is weak, the faith of loved ones can be that tassel of Christ, touching and healing me vicariously.\nRELATED ENTRIES Despair, Dry, Lost, Marriage\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Human beings cannot receive answers to questions they have never asked.\n-Paul Tillich\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a good bit of agnostic in all of us.

I get to the top of a high peak and notice some caves there. I plan to explore them, but first I sit on a ledge and enjoy the panoramic view. While lazily looking at the woods below me, I see in the distance a black fur ball go by. \u0026ldquo;That couldn\u0026rsquo;t be\u0026hellip;could it?\u0026rdquo; I had heard lots of stories of bears in these parts-some of them were not pleasant stories. I sit there trying to convince myself that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be what I thought it was, but to no avail. I suddenly have a change of heart about visiting those caves and instead want badly to be back home.\nI start my descent, nervously realizing that I will have to go in the vicinity of the fur ball sighting. Sure enough, about halfway down, what should jump out of the woods and right onto my path about thirty yards from me but a big black bear! I had been told by the locals that one of the best ways of dealing with bears in the wild was to make myself as big as possible and to yell and scream in hopes that, at the very least, the bear would find me more trouble than it\u0026rsquo;s worth and go away. So, standing as tall as I could and lifting my puny walking stick high in the air, I let out a yell. But this was no ordinary yell. What was released from my mouth was a roar I had not thought possible for any human being, much less me. I roared and roared and roared. Believe it or not, the bear jumped with fear (honest!) and dove into the brush. I knew that my troubles were not necessarily over though because the bear was ahead of me on the trail and there was simply no other way of getting down. Step by shaky step I descended, and sure enough, as I turned another corner, there was my big buddy, this time sitting on the trail, apparently waiting for me. Once again I emitted a sound I thought only apes could make. Once again the bear jumped back into the woods, but this time-I must admit-he looked more curious (amused?) than frightened! Thankfully that was my last sighting, and I made it back home safely.\nLater, sitting on the back porch and drinking my second Corona, I laughed and asked God why on earth he would send me a bear on my retreat. What was he trying to tell me? God laughed, too. But then, in my imagination, God got serious and said something I\u0026rsquo;ll never forget as long as I live. Reminding me of my unheard of and unbelievable yell, God said to me, \u0026ldquo;You see, I have hidden resources inside you that you cannot even fathom.

I remember how distressed I felt then. At the time it seemed as though I would not survive, and yet here I am today looking back at what is now just a distant memory. I allow Jesus to console me now, telling me that we will get through this- that one day this seemingly fatal moment will also be only a memory. If I feel called to do so, I place my problems and fears back into the hands of God and renew my trust in his divine providence.\nI pray over Jesus\u0026rsquo; agony in the garden of Gethsemane. In my imagination I kneel next to Jesus in his moment of despair. I see the tears and sweat dripping from his face and realize that he is as terrified and distressed as I feel right now. I allow this distraught Jesus to tell me about his anguish. I thank and praise Jesus for choosing to go through such a terrible ordeal for me. I try to console Jesus and let him know that he is going to be OK, that things will get very bad but that he will resurrect in the end.

Here are some helpful tips about discernment from my favorite saint, Ignatius Loyola:\nWhen in desolation, I should not make any big decisions. When I am depressed or in a foul mood, my objectivity goes out the window. Therefore, it is better for me to stick with prior commitments until I feel better.\nI should pray for Ignatian indifference. \u0026ldquo;Ignatian indifference\u0026rdquo; refers to a state of mind wherein I am completely open to doing whatever God wants me to do. I need to pray for this grace before I begin to make my decision. Otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;ll really be justifying my own wishes by saying, \u0026ldquo;I prayed about it.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the beginning of the discernment, I must remember the end for which I am striving. I should write out a personal mission statement at the beginning of the discernment process so that I don\u0026rsquo;t confuse the end with the various means to that end.\nThe option that looks holier may not actually be holier. Jesus says that the devil comes as a wolf in sheep\u0026rsquo;s clothing. For example, the evil spirit may convince a battered wife that it is God\u0026rsquo;s will to stay with this dangerous man.\nThe spirit of peace is usually a sign of God\u0026rsquo;s will. In prayer I should imagine each of my options played out. Then I should observe which option brings me more peace when I dream about it. That peace may be God\u0026rsquo;s way of telling me to go in that direction.\nAt the end of my life, which way would I like to look back upon? In prayer I should imagine myself on my deathbed or up in heaven playing the videotape of my life in front of God. What would I want God to see on that tape?\nOnce I think I have my answer, I should await confirmation from God. Even after I\u0026rsquo;ve come to a decision, I should place that decision before God several times, asking him to confirm that it is the right one.\nI need a spiritual guide. I should keep sharing my discernment process with a wise and holy person. Ignatius says that the devil likes for me to keep secrets.\nOnce the process is over, I should boldly act according to the fruits of my discernment. I should turn over this decision to God and not let the future frighten me.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES DEUTERONOMY 30:11-20: I have set before you life and death-choose life\n1 KINGS 3:1-15: Give me wisdom to judge right from wrong\nWISDOM 9:1-11: Give me wisdom that sits by your throne\nSIRACH 14:20-27: Happy the one who meditates on wisdom\nISAIAH 30:15-21: By waiting you shall be told, \u0026ldquo;This is the way; walk in it.\u0026rdquo;\nJEREMIAH 29:11-14: I know well the plans I have for you, plans of fullness\nJEREMIAH 31:31-34: Deep within I will write my law\nMATTHEW 7: On prayer and discernment\nMARK 10:46-52: The blind man Bartimaeus: \u0026ldquo;I want to see!\u0026rdquo;\nEPHESIANS 5:8-21: Try to discern the will of the Lord\n1 JOHN 4: Test the spirits to see whether they are from God\nPRAYER POINTERS Before praying about my options, I ask God to give me the grace of Ignatian indifference, a state of being wherein I am completely open to whatever it is God wants of me. If I am in that state, I allow myself some time to feel the power and the freedom of this grace.\nIn prayer I write out a personal mission statement. I ask myself, \u0026ldquo;What is the end for which I strive?\u0026rdquo; I spend some time on this, knowing that until I\u0026rsquo;m clear about this, I will be tempted to confuse the end with the various means.\nIn my prayerful imagination, I play out my life as it would go if I chose Option A; then I play out my life as if I chose Option B, and so on. While playing these options out, I observe which one brings peace in my heart. Saint Ignatius Loyola says that this is usually the clearest sign of God\u0026rsquo;s will.\nOnce I think I\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at an answer, I spend more time in prayer asking God for confirmation of that choice. In other words, I ask God to let me know somehow that this choice, indeed, is God\u0026rsquo;s will.\nOnce I have come to my decision, I don\u0026rsquo;t look back.

This was my attempt at an explanation:\nNot very often, but every now and then, a person gets a moment of epiphany, a moment when every little tiny thing in the world seems just right and nothing, nothing seems out of place. The thing about those moments is that they usually occur at the most ordinary times. Reading this poem, I imagine Williams sitting on a porch somewhere in the country with a cup of coffee, a pencil and a blank sheet of paper beside him. In my imagination Williams has had writer\u0026rsquo;s block for several days and is frustrated and angry about his complete lack of creativity. Then all of a sudden, for just a moment, while looking across the yard at the wheelbarrow and the chickens, he felt completely and utterly happy. The moment passed-but nothing was ever the same again.\nYears ago, during the time I was teaching high school in Dallas, I wrote the following in my prayer journal:\nI woke up on Saturday, showered, dressed and was pouring a cup of coffee in my travel mug, preparing to drive to a wrestling meet when the thought came to me, \u0026ldquo;I could do this for a long, long time.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;this\u0026rdquo; in that statement was not only high school teaching but also Dallas, this community, this wrestling chaplaincy, this coffee mug- everything.\nAlthough that moment occurred over eight years ago, I still remember every detail of it. I remember the grogginess in my head, the smell of the strong New Orleans coffee, the comforting feel of the twenty-year-old \u0026ldquo;Jesuit\u0026rdquo; sweatshirt I was wearing. And, like Williams, I remember feeling completely happy.\nA few years later I had to leave high school teaching for four years of graduate school in Boston. But throughout this time, I kept remembering that moment with the sweatshirt and the coffee mug. And when asked by my superiors what I might like to do after grad school, my answer came easily. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to go back to high school work,\u0026rdquo; I said. And today, here I am, plowing through American Literature with all of you. And I am perfectly happy.\nAnd it was all because of that moment.\nso much depends\nupon\nthe weather-beaten\nsweatshirt\nbeside the white plastic\ncoffee mug\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1-2: The creation stories\nЈов 42:10-17: The Lord restores Job\u0026rsquo;s prosperity\nPSALM 116: What return shall I make for the good he has done for me?\nDANIEL 3:52-90: All things bless the Lord\nMATTHEW 5:1-12: The beatitudes\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things\nPHILIPPIANS 4:4-13: I have learned to cope in every circumstance\nPRAYER POINTERS Ignatius speaks of an experience he calls \u0026ldquo;consolation without previous cause.\u0026rdquo; He says that at times God will grant me the experience of complete peace and contentedness. By \u0026ldquo;without previous cause\u0026rdquo; he means that this peace and joy may come despite the fact that there are still many problems in my life and despite the fact that nothing extraordinarily wonderful is going on at the time. Despite all of this, I feel cockeyed with joy! Ignatius says that this is one of the most grace-filled experiences one will have in this life and that one should not analyze or scrutinize it, but rather one should simply bask in its warmth and comfort. In my prayer then, I should not try to figure out why it is that I\u0026rsquo;m so happy right now. Instead, I simply sing God\u0026rsquo;s praises and enjoy the gift of happiness.\nI should take advantage of this joyous moment by responding in generosity to God\u0026rsquo;s goodness.

But I am more often called to do so with gentle cajoling than with angry confrontation. There are two major problems with confrontation. First, if I am honest with myself, I will see that my confrontation is often rooted in my own anger rather than in Christian love. Second, in the promotion of Christian values and ideals, confrontation is often an ineffective tool. It causes the person being confronted to be defensive of the status quo rather than open to new ideas or new ways of life. If, however, I couch my words in unconditional love and acceptance, then that person will feel less threatened by the challenge to change. The old adage is true: I can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\nThere are times, however, when the most loving thing to do is to openly confront someone. If I feel inclined to do so, then I must spend a lot of time in prayer, discerning whether this is truly God\u0026rsquo;s will. I must thoroughly explore my motives and my plan of action. I must also spiritually prepare myself for rejection and perhaps even hatred. Archbishop Oscar Romero, because he opposed the massacres conducted by the El Salvadoran military, knew that it was only a matter of time before he would be assassinated. Jesus had a strong sense of what was ahead for him as he prayed in the garden of Gethsemane about his inevitable crucifixion. Luke tells us, \u0026ldquo;In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.\u0026rdquo; In my personal experience, however (and it seems to be so in the experience of Jesus and of Romero as well), I have discovered that a certain peace can be drawn from the knowledge that I am doing my best, and that since this is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s work, I can trust that the Lord will take good care of me. J. Lubbock has a very simple statement about this: \u0026ldquo;When we have done our best, we should await the result in peace.\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t say how many times I have drawn strength from this little maxim. During the times when I feel called by God to do something unpleasant, this statement becomes a sort of mantra for me. I whisper it to my anxious heart over and over again not only in my prayer times but throughout the difficult days. I often find that the peace I draw from that mantra is contagious-that it spreads to all of the others involved. Even those on the receiving end of the confrontation or bad news seem to be affected by my demeanor of quiet serenity. Through that peace, I have found that I am better able to convey my sincere love for that person, which hopefully is the root of my unpleasant words and actions.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES EXODUS 3:4-14: God calls Moses to confront Pharaoh\n2 SAMUEL 12:1-13: Nathan confronts David\nPSALM 27: Though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident\nJEREMIAH 1:15-19: Jeremiah sent to confront the nations\nJEREMIAH 20:7-18: I could not keep quiet\nMATTHEW 7:1-5: Don\u0026rsquo;t judge others\nMATTHEW 18:15-20: If someone has a problem\nMATTHEW 23:1-39: Jesus versus the Pharisees\nMARK 8:31-33: Jesus to Peter: \u0026ldquo;Get away from me, Satan\u0026rdquo;\nLUKE 2:22-35: A sword will pierce your soul\nLUKE 9:44-62: The Son of Man will be betrayed\nLUKE 12:1-12: When they bring you before the authorities\nLUKE 12:49-59: I have not come to bring peace, but division!\nLUKE 21:12-19: Dark days are coming\nLUKE 22:31-34: I have prayed for you, Peter\nROMANS 8:26-39: What can separate us from the love of Christ?\nGALATIANS 2:11-14: Paul publicly confronts Peter\nGALATIANS 6:1-10: If someone is in sin, gently set him right\n1 PETER 3:8-17: Be prepared to give an account for the hope that is in you\nPRAYER POINTERS I use Lubbock\u0026rsquo;s quote as my mantra in prayer.

In the midst of it one day, I realized why it was such a comfort to me. I prayed the rosary while trying to adjust to a new assignment because the rosary brought me back home. It brought me back to the place I felt most stable and secure: my childhood. My memories of praying the rosary with my family are almost palpable. I remember all of us kneeling on the wooden floor of the living room of our small wood-frame house on West Keller Street. I remember the tiny candlelight and the darkness surrounding it. I remember the feel of the rosary beads between my fingers and the sound of the cadences of Hail Marys, Our Fathers and Glory Be to the Fathers. I returned to the rosary during that time of transition because the rosary, and all those other Catholic rituals, were an important link between my past and present.\nThere is a quiet little gesture that the priest performs in the middle of the Mass that many Catholics probably don\u0026rsquo;t always notice. Just after the Lamb of God, the priest breaks a tiny piece of the host and drops it into the chalice. Legend has it that this ritual goes all the way back to the early church. Before there were priests, only bishops could consecrate the bread and wine. But before long there were so many Christians in the city that they could not handle all the crowds, so the new office of the priesthood was established. In the beginning the people were afraid of change-they did not believe that a priest had the authority to consecrate. So young men stood by during the bishop\u0026rsquo;s Mass, and just after the consecration, the bishop handed each of them a small piece of the host. They ran all through the city dropping the small pieces into the chalices of the priests\u0026rsquo; Masses. This symbolic gesture taught the people that there is only one Sacrifice of the Mass in which we all participate. We still do this liturgical gesture today to remind us of the same lesson. It reminds us that the Mass I celebrate in Houston is the same Mass my family is celebrating in my hometown in Louisiana. It\u0026rsquo;s the same Mass my Jesuit friend is celebrating in Siberia, the same Mass as is celebrated in every place I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had to say good-bye to. It\u0026rsquo;s the same Mass as the pope\u0026rsquo;s in Rome, and it\u0026rsquo;s the same Eternal Banquet that is celebrated by all my loved ones and ancestors who have gone ahead of me to heaven.\nWhen I am going through a difficult period of change in my life, I seek the consolation of those ancient rituals that remind me of my God and Savior, who is beyond all change.

At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, \u0026lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.\u0026rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, \u0026lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.\u0026rsquo; Another said, \u0026lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.\u0026rdquo; -Luke 14:16-19\nGod wills that I work hard and contribute to the progress of humanity. But God does not will for me to be too busy. If I am too busy, then I am not taking care of the body, mind and spirit that God has entrusted to me. Nor am I doing any favors to those I serve, since I am not truly giving my healthiest, holiest, happiest self. So, while there may be brief periods when I must endure an overwhelming schedule, I should not allow myself to be in a permanent state of being overwhelmed with tasks to perform. If I do find myself in such a state, I must first admit that this is the result of choices that I made. I simply bit off more than I could chew. I said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to more things than I could handle. The solution would be for me to learn to say \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; If this has been a problem for a while, then I need to explore in prayer what my motivation is for hurting myself this way.\nOne motivation may be that I am addicted to work. Just as I could misuse alcohol, drugs and food, so, too, could I misuse God\u0026rsquo;s gift of work. A second motivation may be that I simply don\u0026rsquo;t love myself enough to take good care of myself. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself as the precious and fragile gift that I am. A third motivation may be that of arrogance. It is arrogant of me to think that I must be the one to solve everyone\u0026rsquo;s problems. It is humble of me to admit my limitations and my inability to be the savior of anything. A hardworking priest who was taking some time off from his busy job was stopped on the street by an alcoholic, homeless man. The man told the priest about his many serious problems and asked him for money. The priest looked at him with sincere compassion and said, \u0026ldquo;I see that you have very real and very serious problems, and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for that. But I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that I\u0026rsquo;m the one who can help you with those problems right now. All that I can do is promise to pray for you.\u0026rdquo; This priest was not selfish or uncaring; he simply knew his limitations and was humble enough to admit it to himself and to the homeless man. But you can imagine what the homeless guy thought of the priest! Which brings up a fourth motivation for not being able to say \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; Very often, I am not strong enough to take others\u0026rsquo; rejection of me. I feel guilty because someone else is angry or disappointed with me. But in order to live a happy, healthy, holy life I must accept that I will at times disappoint or anger others. There are simply no other options if I wish to care for myself in the way that God wills.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1:1-2:4: God created the heavens and the earth, then God rested\nPSALM 62: My soul rests in God alone\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nECCLESIASTES 1:1-2:26: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nMATTHEW 11:28-30: Come to me, all you who are weary\nMATTHEW 24:36-51: We do not know the day or the hour\nMARK 6:30-33: Come away awhile\nLUKE 9:57-62: Let me bury my father first\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things\nLUKE 14:15-24: Dinner guests are too busy to accept the invitation\nLUKE 16:19-31: The rich man and Lazarus\nPRAYER POINTERS Sometimes God asks me to do overwhelmingly difficult work. At other times, I simply have taken on more work than I should have. My first task in prayer, then, is to discern whether this busyness is God\u0026rsquo;s will or if it is simply my problem of overloading myself with work.\nIf it is God\u0026rsquo;s will for me right now, then I beg God for the strength to endure. I join my sufferings to Jesus\u0026rsquo; ordeal of the Passion. In that light, I see that God is not asking of me anything that his Son did not himself endure. I see that my task is puny compared to Jesus\u0026rsquo; most difficult work. I draw strength from knowing that my God is with me and has preceded me.\nIf it is my problem of overburdening myself, then I must explore the roots of this problem. Why is it that I have done this to myself? Is this a pattern in my life? Am I addicted to work? Do I love myself enough to take good care of myself? Do I arrogantly see myself as the only one who can solve these problems?\nI prayerfully consider if there are one or more tasks that God would like me to let go of at this time. I pray for the courage and strength it will take for me to admit to others that I simply can\u0026rsquo;t handle this right now. I spiritually prepare myself for the consequences, knowing that God will be with me through it all. I pray over my calendar, evaluating each item this way.\nRELATED ENTRIES Confront, Hate, Ministry, Noontime, Stressed, Weary\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Burnout is when your true motives come home to roost.\n-Anonymous\nThe mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\n-Wilhelm Stekel, quoted in The Catcher in the Rye by J.

My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed. -Psalm 139:14-16\nOne lazy summer day a couple of years ago, I was playing with my nephews, Cameron and Dillon. They were taking turns doing tricks on Cameron\u0026rsquo;s new scooter. It looked easy to ride (famous last words), so I said, \u0026ldquo;Let me give it a try.\u0026rdquo; It took about twenty seconds for me to flip over the thing, careening into the mud. Afterward, I noticed that I had a fairly large cut on my leg from my wipeout. I cleaned it up and forgot about it.\nA few days later, I spent five days alone in the hill country of Texas so that I could write without distraction. During those reflective days, I was unusually observant of the healing process of that cut. I watched in awe as the cut grew uglier and more \u0026ldquo;colorful,\u0026rdquo; then gradually more natural- looking and harmless. One day I noticed perfectly smooth and unblemished pink skin all around it. It stirred me to consider the ease with which my body could recover from injury and \u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo; entirely new and perfect parts of itself. Now, weeks later, there is only the tiniest of scars left. A part of me wonders if my body could have gotten rid of even the scar but chose to keep it around in order to remind me that I\u0026rsquo;m a little too old now for scooters!\nI have always been fascinated by the phenomenon of homeostasis, the body\u0026rsquo;s ability to maintain balance and equilibrium in all of its systems. Many bodily functions that we consider problems are actually solutions from the perspective of the body. It is the body, not the disease, that causes fever. It does so because many bacteria cannot survive at higher temperatures. The body causes vomiting when it detects poison in the system and wants to flush itself clean. Sometimes headaches occur because the body, sensing that oxygen levels in the brain are a little low, rushes more of it upward. Homeostasis also refers to the unbelievable ability to keep my body temperature almost precisely the same whether I go for a run in the eleven-degree cold of Cambridge, Massachusetts, or in the ninety-one- degree heat of Houston, Texas. Now, how can that be? How can I be created so marvelously? It takes my breath away just to think about what an amazing wonder is this clumsy, beat-up, slightly overweight body of mine. When I praise the Lord, I do so for the gifts of family, vocation, friends, granted favors and undeserved graces. But how often do I sit in awe of the giftedness of my thumb, of the industry of my digestive system, of the particularity of my pinky-toe?\nI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

A cushioned chair that forces me to sit up straight usually does the trick. In the long run, breathing is easier and more relaxed when I\u0026rsquo;m sitting up. I sit quietly a few moments, allowing my breathing to slow down and my body to relax.\nWithout moving and in that same quiet state, I focus all of my attention on the big toe of my right foot. I \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; the presence of that toe as I never have before. I feel its contentment with simply \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; there at the end of my foot. In my heart I say to God repeatedly, \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Lord.\u0026rdquo; After a while, I move on to my entire right foot. I note its peacefulness and tranquility-its lack of anxiety or fear. I say again, \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Lord.\u0026rdquo; I now allow its partner, the left foot, into the reflection, noting its quietness and thanking God for creating it. I slowly move up past my feet and focus on the solitude of the shin. I continue moving slowly up my body, noting at each stage how peaceful and content each body part is and thanking God for it. I do this exercise very slowly, spending a while at each spot without becoming stuck on any one.\nWhen I have reached the top of my head, I pull away slowly and try to get a sense of my entire body as a \u0026ldquo;unified whole\u0026rdquo; at rest and at peace. I go back \u0026ldquo;into my body\u0026rdquo; very slowly, traveling through my various body parts, again observing the stillness that pervades everywhere.

Then the LORD said to Cain, \u0026ldquo;Where is your brother Abel?\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother\u0026rsquo;s keeper?\u0026rdquo; And the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;What have you done? Listen; your brother\u0026rsquo;s blood is crying out to me from the ground\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; Genesis 4:8-10\nThere are rare occasions when blowing up is the right thing to do. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;m called by God to shake people out of their traditional way of thinking or acting. I must be the one to stop the speeding train from careening over a cliff, and the only way to do so is to crash into it head-on myself. As a teacher, a parent, a friend, a leader, a citizen, a church member, I am sometimes called to stand up and turn over the tables of the moneychangers. The only good motive for ever doing so is love. I decide that the most loving thing that I can do at this moment is to destroy the comfortable godless world in which people are dwelling.\nBut those times are rare. Most of the time when I blow up, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve lost control of my own passions, and I explode like an erupted pressure cooker. Why do people explode in anger? A friend of mine who is active in Alcoholics Anonymous taught me the H.A.L.T. formula. She said, \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re about to blow up and do something stupid, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to H.A.L.T. and ask yourself, \u0026lsquo;Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired?\u0026rsquo; Once you\u0026rsquo;ve determined which of these four is the problem, you can work on fixing that relatively simple need rather than losing control and behaving destructively.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom another perspective, science tells us that every species of animal in the world generally reacts to perceived threats in one of two ways: fight or flight. When I\u0026rsquo;m courageous enough to pray about my outbursts of anger, I often discover that the motive behind the outburst was not love at all but rather some unacknowledged fear deep inside me. Often, when I explode, it\u0026rsquo;s because, far below the level of consciousness, I feel terribly threatened, and I am desperately trying to save myself.\nShould this be the case, then, in my prayer, as I look back on my outburst, I must courageously allow Jesus to ask me, \u0026ldquo;What did you feel threatened by?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a tough question to face. If I exploded emotionally, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because of a deep-seated pain. It will not reveal its frightened self easily. I will have to approach it gingerly, carefully, slowly. I must beg God to give me the strength and the courage to face this wound with integrity and humility. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve confronted my threatened self, I can then ask Christ to begin the slow process of healing me. On a practical level, I can seek ways to feel more secure in similar situations.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 4:1-15: Cain kills Abel\nPSALM 103: The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nPROVERBS 14:17: A quick tempered man does foolish things\nISAIAH 2:2-5: They shall beat their swords into plowshares\nMATTHEW 5:21-26: Everyone who grows angry shall be liable to judgment\nMATTHEW 5:38-43: Love your enemies\nMATTHEW 21:18-22: Jesus curses the fig tree\nMATTHEW 26:47-56: The one who lives by the sword shall die by the sword\nMARK 11:15-19: Jesus cleanses the temple\nLUKE 9:51-56: Jesus chides the apostles about their revenge\nJOHN 2:13-25: Jesus and the moneychangers\nACTS 15: Paul and Barnabas fight and split\nROMANS 12:17-21: \u0026ldquo;Vengeance is mine,\u0026rdquo; says the Lord\nEPHESIANS 4:25-32: Do not let the sun go down on your anger\nJAMES 3: No one can tame the tongue-a restless evil, full of poison\nPRAYER POINTERS As painful as it is to do so, I pray for those who hurt me and for those whom I have hurt. I ask the Lord to bless these people with his abundant love and grace.\nIf I have blown up recently, it would be good for me to practice stillness in my prayer. I should ask the Lord for the grace of inner peace. Praying over Psalm 131 or using a mantra such as \u0026ldquo;Still me, O Lord\u0026rdquo; might help.\nSometimes I discover in my prayer that I feel threatened by a particular person. In my journal, I write him or her a letter that I never intend to send. That way, I can be uncensored in laying down my own vulnerability and fear. The purpose of this letter is not to reconcile with the person, but rather to get in touch with my own fear. By addressing the letter to the person whom I fear, I am beginning the slow process of facing him or her. After I have written the letter, I should read it aloud to Jesus and ask him for consolation and healing. Only then can Jesus and I begin to discern how to reconcile with that person.\nAfter praying over the question, \u0026ldquo;What am I threatened by?\u0026rdquo;, I might also explore the following questions: \u0026ldquo;Would it be appropriate for me to attempt to reconcile with those I may have hurt? If so, how? Am I ready to forgive myself for losing it? Do those I\u0026rsquo;ve hurt know that I love them?

Here\u0026rsquo;s one of mine:\nJanuary, 2000\nAt approximately six o\u0026rsquo;clock this morning, I put on my running gear and ran six miles along the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The temperature was in the upper teens or lower twenties! I almost turned around at several points in the first few minutes of the run. My hands were so cold that I had to keep twirling my fingers just to keep the circulation going. My strange high-tech running suit managed to cover practically every part of me. But there was a small, one-inch triangle of flesh at the bottom of my neck where the zipper of my suit did not come all the way up to meet my ski mask. In that biting cold, I was introduced to this small spot on my body that I had never noticed before. When I reached the frozen river, I saw the Boston skyline in a gradually more oranging sky and was grateful that I had not turned around and missed this. A little farther on, the trail left Storrow Drive and went through a park area where all I saw were trees on my right and the river on my left. While running beside it, I spent a while observing the thin sheet of ice that had formed on the surface of the river. Twenty minutes into the run, I emerged from a particularly engrossing and absorbing conversation with God to realize to my great surprise that I was no longer cold. All body parts were warm and comfortable even my newfound little spot! I was awestruck at my body\u0026rsquo;s ability to regulate its own temperature, even in these conditions. Fifty minutes into the run, I had come full circle and was home again-happy that it was over, but a little sad, too. Like Adam in the fresco on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, for just a moment I felt the touch of God on my flesh.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s your story?\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1:1-2:4: The creation story\nJOB 38-41: The Lord speaks of his creation\nPSALM 8: The Lord\u0026rsquo;s majesty\nPSALM 29: The God of glory thunders over mighty waters\nPSALM 104: Bless the Lord, O my soul\nPSALM 145: One generation shall laud your works to another\nDANIEL 3:52-90: All things bless the Lord\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nCOLOSSIANS 1:3-20: By him, all things were created\nPRAYER POINTERS If I am currently experiencing one of these moments of epiphany with nature, then I bask in the wonder of it.

But is this an image of an all-loving God? Would I want such a person as a friend? A spouse? A teacher? A parent? God is not like this at all. If I want a good image of God, I should think of the most loving and compassionate person in my life and imagine God to be infinitely more loving and compassionate. Furthermore, God desires that we have an intimate relationship with him. And because I am human, I naturally will have problems in this relationship. I will get angry with God as I sometimes get angry with my spouse, my friend, my parents and so on.\nThe Bible is filled with examples of friends of God who at one time or another got angry with him. Sarah cynically laughed at God\u0026rsquo;s promise that she and Abraham would have a child in their old age. Jacob wrestled with an angel for a blessing. The Israelites in the desert complained about the food. In the New Testament, though Jesus was divine, his best friends often argued with him. Here are a few examples:\n\u0026ldquo;Lord, we have been fishing all day and have caught nothing. Now you\u0026rsquo;re telling us to go back out there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;OK, fine. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to Jerusalem to die with Jesus.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you had been here, Lazarus would not have died.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not care, Lord, that we\u0026rsquo;re all going to die?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lord, if we have no idea where you are going, how can we follow?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I have to die for you Lord, will your beloved disciple have to die, too?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Jesus himself, at the most important moment of his life, shouted at God, \u0026ldquo;My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps the best example of a healthy conflict with God is that of Old Testament hero Job, who for chapters and chapters shook his fist at God. Biblical scholars say that the vocabulary of much of Job\u0026rsquo;s ranting implies that Job actually wanted to take God to court. He wanted to convict God in a heavenly court of law. When Job made that seemingly beautiful statement, \u0026ldquo;I know that my Redeemer lives\u0026rdquo; (Job 19:25), he actually was referring to a heavenly being who could help him to convict God in this celestial trial!\nIn every one of these examples, God remained faithful and did not condemn the angry follower. At times God fought back, but only when it would help the person to grow. Sarah bore a child and became the mother of the Judeo-Christian world. Jacob got his blessing. The Israelites were given the Promised Land. Peter became pope. And Job, having lost his court battle, was blessed with riches and great wisdom.\nSo, if you have a beef with God, what are you waiting for? Go after him!\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES EXODUS 5: Lord, you have not rescued your people\nNUMBERS 11:10-15: Lord, why have you treated me so badly?\nЈов 7:11-19: I will complain in the bitterness of my soul\nЈов 19:23-27: I know that my Redeemer lives\nPSALM 22: My God, why have you forsaken me?\nPSALM 88: Lord, my soul is full of troubles\nJEREMIAH 20:7-18: You duped me, O Lord\nLAMENTATIONS 3: I have seen affliction\nJONAH 4: Jonah\u0026rsquo;s anger at the Lord\u0026rsquo;s compassion\nMARK 4:35-41: Do you not care that we\u0026rsquo;re going to die?\nJOHN 11:1-44: Martha: \u0026ldquo;Lord, if you had been here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHEBREWS 12:5-13: Lift your drooping hands and strengthen weak knees\nPRAYER POINTERS Looking at these various biblical characters, I notice that some of God\u0026rsquo;s best friends were sometimes furious with him. And they seemed to have no trouble letting God know that they were angry! With this assurance, I go after God. I sit him in the chair in front of me and I let him have it, telling him every little thing that is bothering me about him right now. I hold nothing back and say everything that comes to mind.\nIf I feel more comfortable doing so, I write God a nasty letter giving him a piece of my mind. Point by point, I spell out all the ways I feel that he has screwed up my life. Again, I hold nothing back.\nThroughout my ranting, I imagine God sitting quietly and listening with great care and great love. When I have exhausted myself with all that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to say, I sit quietly and allow God to respond. I let God say or do anything he wants. Perhaps he will reach out to embrace me. Perhaps he will respond to my particular problems, pointing out his logic. Perhaps he will simply ask me to trust. Perhaps he will yell back! Perhaps he will remain silent and distant.\nI respond to God in whatever way feels natural. I may need to yell some more. I may need to melt in his arms. I may need to keep my distance for a while. I may need to ask questions. I allow myself to say or do whatever my heart leads me to do.\nIf I am really angry with God, there is a good chance that I will have to pray about this for a long time. At the end of each prayer time, I tell God that I love him and accept his will for me in my life and trust that his will is always what is best for me. If my heart cannot say these words right now, I let my own will do the talking for me.\nRELATED ENTRIES Angry, Dry, Grieving, Ministry\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU I chased him until he caught me.\n-Anonymous\nDear Lord, if this is how you treat your friends, it is no wonder you have so few!\n-Saint Teresa of Avila\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/4.-god-im-angry-at-you/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThose who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, \u0026ldquo;Aha!

On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \u0026ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\u0026rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village. (Luke 9:51-55)\nI have righteous anger when I have been unjustifiably wronged and am justifiably angry about it. In and of itself, righteous anger is amoral; it is neither sinful nor virtuous. It has some good qualities. For example, it was righteous anger that led Candy Lightner, an angry mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver, to start the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which works to end drunk driving in America. But righteous anger can be dangerous. Psychologically speaking, it is a defense mechanism I use to give me power when I feel powerless in the face of some evil done to me. If I\u0026rsquo;m not careful, I can become addicted to the power it brings me. I can stew in the delicious strength I feel from the rage inside me. If I do not ultimately let it go, it will consume me over time.\nIf anyone had a right to have righteous anger, it would be the crucified Jesus. He was purely innocent and yet died a savage and brutal death. But instead of being angry, as he hangs in excruciating pain, Jesus cries out, \u0026ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u0026rdquo; Spiritual writer Thomas Hart humorously points out that, for the apostles, the appearance of the resurrected Jesus might not necessarily be a good thing. After all, how would you feel if the friend that you had betrayed and abandoned came back from the dead to see you? Jesus had every right to be furious with his apostles to say, \u0026ldquo;Where were you? After all I\u0026rsquo;ve done for you!\u0026rdquo; But instead, Jesus granted them amnesty: \u0026ldquo;Peace is my gift to you,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nPerhaps this is part of what it means to be resurrected: to relinquish one\u0026rsquo;s right to be angry and to wish and work for peace on earth and good will toward all, even toward one\u0026rsquo;s perpetrators. Until we reach this point, we will still be mortally wounded. The New Testament says that God the Father raised Jesus from the dead. If this is true about Jesus, this will certainly be true for us, too. We cannot resurrect ourselves; we must let God raise us. And like Jesus, we must spend some time in the tomb. We must wait for the gift to come. The question is, \u0026ldquo;What will we do with this anger in the meantime?\u0026rdquo;\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 27:1-45; 33:1-20: Jacob and Esau\nGENESIS 37:1-36; 42:1-45:28: The story of Joseph\nMATTHEW 21:18-22: Jesus curses the fig tree\nMATTHEW 23:1-39: Jesus versus the Pharisees\nMARK 8:31-33: Jesus to Peter: \u0026ldquo;Get away from me, Satan!\u0026rdquo;\nJOHN 2:13-25: Jesus cleanses the temple\nJOHN 21:1-25: Jesus forgives Peter\nEPHESIANS 4:25-32: Do not let the sun go down on your anger\nPRAYER POINTERS After reaching stillness, I imagine myself sitting in one of three chairs in an empty room. I ask myself, \u0026ldquo;Who is the person whom I am most angry with at this moment? My brother? My spouse? My boss? Why am I angry with him or her? What am I feeling deep down in my heart about him or her?\u0026rdquo; I do not settle on the first answers that I come up with. I keep probing- asking myself these questions until I feel I have reached the core of the issues.\nI then imagine that very person sitting in one of the empty chairs. I imagine this person telling me everything he or she is feeling about me and about the present situation. I imagine this person speaking without fear, anxiety or embarrassment. What would he or she say? I listen quietly and attentively to the words spoken.\nI now share with this person what I have discovered are my deep emotions right now. I imagine myself without fear, anxiety or embarrassment and able to say exactly what I am feeling. If I need to yell and scream at him or her for a while, I go for it. Again, I say exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling without any censorship.\nI now notice Jesus sitting in the third chair and listening intently to our conversation. I ask him to share with me his feelings about this situation. What does he say? Is he happy? Disappointed? Does he have some insight the other two of us haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of? What is my response? How should my attitude and actions toward this person change because of this encounter with Jesus? I allow a three-way conversation to continue, allowing everyone a chance to say anything he or she wishes.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m really angry right now, I may have to pray about this for a while. Each time I pray this prayer time, I end it by telling this person that I love him or her regardless of how I feel right now. It is extremely important that I end the prayer time with words of love for this person. If my heart is not ready to say these words, I let my will do the talking.

Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, \u0026ldquo;Peace be with you.

For example, if I feel frightened by the notion of speaking out against some unjust practice at work, I\u0026rsquo;ll want to ask myself, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of? Rejection by my peers? Rejection by my superiors? Am I afraid of conflict itself? Am I afraid of losing my job?\u0026rdquo;\nEach day that I pray over this situation, I want to dig deeper into my fears. Each time I ask the question, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of?\u0026rdquo;, I should try to discover a deeper answer. Using the example above, I may discover after a number of prayer times that I am afraid of my boss. I then want to ask myself again, \u0026ldquo;What is it about my boss that I\u0026rsquo;m really afraid of?\u0026rdquo; І may then discover that my boss reminds me of my overbearing mother who disciplined me through fear. Or, I may feel a need to impress my boss and am afraid to get on her bad side. Or, I may realize that I feel my job is constantly threatened that the boss could fire me at any moment. If losing my job is the fear, I may come back and ask the question again, \u0026ldquo;What is it I\u0026rsquo;m really afraid of?\u0026rdquo; I may discover that beneath the fear of losing my job is a terrible fear of being an inadequate father. Now we\u0026rsquo;re getting somewhere! But I haven\u0026rsquo;t arrived at this root cause of my fear until after I have spent a great deal of time in prayer, asking myself again and again, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of?\u0026rdquo;\nThe next step, of course, would be to allow Jesus to enter that scary place with me. My friend Paul once told me of a prayer experience whereby he and Jesus were walking through the many rooms of his house-a metaphor for his very self. After a while they came to a locked door that represented Paul\u0026rsquo;s most frightening parts of himself, and he said to Jesus, \u0026ldquo;Sorry, Lord, I can\u0026rsquo;t let you in that door.\u0026rdquo; For several prayer times more, Paul reflected on how much of his emotional and spiritual life is spent guarding that door -keeping everyone, including Jesus and even himself, from entering it. You can imagine the liberation Paul finally experienced when he gathered up the courage to walk into that room with Jesus.\nI must do the same. I must take Jesus\u0026rsquo; hand and walk into my own dark, cobwebbed room. I sit on the floor awhile with him and get a feel for this place I\u0026rsquo;ve run from for so long. I let Jesus light a candle, so that we can see it clearly and describe it to one another.

They provide the impetus I need to finally surrender my life to God. My addiction is \u0026ldquo;exhibit A\u0026rdquo; among my proofs for why I can\u0026rsquo;t manage the job of being my own savior. I have many other proofs, but this one is the most convincing. Without my addiction, I could almost convince myself that I don\u0026rsquo;t need a savior. But try as I might, no matter what I do, no matter how many degrees I get, or how many friends I have, or how many promises I make, or how many times a day I pray, I cannot get a handle on my addiction. I am powerless over it. I will need a higher power to rescue me from it.\nSome of the happiest, healthiest, holiest people I know are alcoholics who speak freely of their addiction. It is as though they have found some sort of freedom in being able to say, \u0026ldquo;I give up. I can\u0026rsquo;t handle it, and I won\u0026rsquo;t fight it anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m an alcoholic: I am powerless in the face of alcohol.\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine the relief one must feel in being able to finally let go of the battles and ask Christ to be one\u0026rsquo;s champion.

God, I'm Addicted"},{"content":"INTRODUCTION Speaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, \u0026ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.\u0026rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I\u0026rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life. I might be filled with joy returning from a family camping trip, or I might be seething with anger about an argument I\u0026rsquo;ve just had with my best friend. I might have my dying grandmother in mind, or I simply might want to relax in the stillness of the evening. Often I have a strong sense that God is calling me to bring this mood or situation to our quiet time together. But often, I feel the need for a customized \u0026ldquo;prayer starter\u0026rdquo;: a Bible passage that deals with my current mood, a short reflection I can use to begin my conversation with God, a concrete suggestion about how to pray in this particular situation or a pithy quote I can easily memorize and carry with me as I exit my prayer and enter my day. Sitting in my prayer chair with coffee mug in hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I wish I had a book in which I could look up the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in today to get me started on my prayer.\u0026rdquo; Searching long and hard for such a book and not finding one, I decided that I ought to take Langford\u0026rsquo;s advice and write one myself. God, I Have Issues is not intended to be read from cover to cover. It is a reference manual to help you bring the stuff of your life into your daily prayer time. The concept is simple: using the various indexes in the back of the book, find the entry that best fits your situation or mood. You can read the entire entry in the first few minutes of your prayer time and plan your prayer accordingly, meditating on one of the suggested Scriptures, pondering the reflection or trying out one of the prayer pointers. In the days that follow, you can use the \u0026ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages\u0026rdquo; section to continue your reflections. If you\u0026rsquo;re still needing more, or if this entry does not quite fit your particular situation, you can check out the suggestions from the \u0026ldquo;Related Entries\u0026rdquo; section. Finally, you can memorize or scribble down a quote from the \u0026ldquo;Words to Take with You\u0026rdquo; section so that you can return to prayer at quiet moments in your day. Some of the quotes are profound and thought provoking, some are just downright silly. But I hope you will find them to be a helpful way of bringing you back to the reflective state of your earlier prayer time.\nOne caution about this book: these entries are intended for psychologically healthy people going through the typical cycle of everyday emotions and situations. It is far beyond the scope of this book to deal with serious emotional or psychological problems. \u0026ldquo;God, I\u0026rsquo;m Sad,\u0026rdquo; for example, is written for the psychologically healthy person who happens to be sad today. A person who is clinically depressed will need to seek professional help and should not rely solely on this or any other spiritual or psychological book for recovery from this serious problem. The same holds for all of the other emotions mentioned in the book.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH THIS BOOK If you are new to meditation and contemplation, I recommend you take the following three steps:\nFind two or three good books that are introductions to this type of prayer. I recommend one of these: Green, Thomas. Opening to God. (Ave Maria Press, 1977.)\nHauser, Richard. In His Spirit. (Paulist Press, 1982.)\nKeating, Thomas. Intimacy with God. (Crossroad/Herder \u0026amp; Herder, 1996.)\nLink, Mark. The Challenge 2000 Series. (Thomas More Press, 1993.)\nThibodeaux, Mark. Armchair Mystic: Easing Into Contemplative Prayer. (St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001.)\nZanzig, Thomas. Learning to Meditate. (St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s Press, 1990.)\nFind a spiritual director, someone who has more experience in contemplation and mediation, who can guide you as you take your first steps and can help you maintain a healthy prayer life once you\u0026rsquo;ve been at it for a while. Find at least one or two peers with whom you can share your spiritual journeys, exchange insights, ideas and so on. Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple formula for using this book in a daily regimen of prayer:\nFind a quiet time and space in which to pray every day. Many pray-ers find the best time to pray to be the early morning and the best place to pray to be a chair that is comfortable but not so much so that one would fall asleep easily. Beside your chair, place whatever helps you to pray: a Bible, a candle, a journal and pen, a spiritual book.\nBefore beginning prayer, ask yourself what topic, emotion, issues or situation God and you might want to work with today. On some days nothing in particular will come to mind. You may want to pray over the liturgical readings of the day or simply have a cup of coffee with Jesus. On other days some particular mood, situation or issue might be very present to you. If so, look up the mood or situation in the book and quickly read over the entire entry. Place the book open-faced beside your chair.\nBegin to quiet yourself. Slow down your breathing. Settle down your thoughts. You might want to hum a simple religious tune or speak a mantra, a holy word or phrase, over and over again. For example, you might want to say the name \u0026ldquo;Jesus\u0026rdquo; very slowly over and over again. Allow yourself to sit in this holy stillness for as long as it feels comfortable.\nIf you feel yourself coming out of that stillness and if it feels right to do so, pick up this book and again skim the entire entry. When you find something that strikes you, ignore all the rest and focus on that one part. For example, if a particular Scripture passage looks appealing, look up that passage and pray over it for the entire prayer period. Or perhaps something in the reflection will strike you; then stay with that thought or insight and have a conversation with God about it. Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ll want to try out one of the \u0026ldquo;Prayer Pointers.\u0026rdquo;\nWhatever you choose to pray with, it is important that you do not clutter your prayer time with activities or even multiple Scripture passages. It is far better to focus on one small point, insight or passage than to jump from one spot to another.\nClose your prayer time with the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, the Glory Be to the Father or some other ready-made prayer. Before leaving your prayer spot, you might want to consider what you\u0026rsquo;ll pray over tomorrow. You might also memorize one of the quotes from \u0026ldquo;Words to Take with You\u0026rdquo; or scribble it on a slip of paper so that you can go back to it here and there during your day.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH SCRIPTURE Those who practice Christian meditation and contemplation find praying with Scriptures to be the bread and butter of their prayer life. Therefore, each entry provides a list of \u0026ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages.\u0026rdquo; In preparing to pray, you might want to peruse the list and look up the passages that seem promising. Settle down with one passage and bookmark that spot in your Bible before beginning to pray. That way you won\u0026rsquo;t have to distract yourself with finding the right passage and flipping to it during the prayer time itself.\nSaint Ignatius Loyola suggests that once you have found a passage that really works in prayer (that is, one that helps you get in touch with God), then you should stay with that passage for as long as it continues to work. If the passage really speaks to you or moves you closer to God, you might pray over the same passage again and again for several days or even weeks. The goal then is not to pray over every single passage relating to your mood or situation, but instead to pray deeply over one or, at most, a few passages.\nIn the same way that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to cover every passage, you might find it more helpful to focus on one small part of one passage. Psalm 139:1-18, for example, is a rich passage filled with many wonderful words, phrases and images. Instead of trying to cover them all in your prayer time, it would be better to choose the one word, phrase or image that speaks to you today and zero in on that one, leaving all the rest of it behind.\nHere are three concrete ways to meditate on Scripture:\nAsk a reflection question. Read the passage and think of a reflection question to discuss with God. Basically, ask God and yourself, \u0026ldquo;What is this passage about?\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;How does this relate to my life?\u0026rdquo;\nPlay a role in the story. Read the Bible story several times and, in your imagination, play the role of one of the characters in the story. Then have a talk with Jesus about what you experienced.\nUse a mantra. The mantra is a word, phrase or sentence that you repeat over and over. Simply pick your favorite line from the passage and very slowly, very prayerfully, say that word, phrase or sentence over and over again. Let it take root in your heart.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH EMOTIONS Why should I pray over my emotions? For the most part, emotions are amoral. That is to say, at least to the extent that I don\u0026rsquo;t choose the particular emotion I\u0026rsquo;m now experiencing, they are neither virtuous nor sinful. Very often, good people make the mistake of trying (either unconsciously or consciously) to repress emotions they consider \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sinful.\u0026rdquo; For example, if I were married, I may unconsciously hold to this fallacy: \u0026ldquo;I must suppress all feelings of anger toward my wife because good husbands feel love and affection for their spouses all the time.\u0026rdquo; The problem is that repressing or suppressing my emotions does not make them go away. On the contrary, strong emotions that are not dealt with straightforwardly will seek some sort of unconscious release. For example, unrepressed anger toward my spouse might lead me to passive-aggressive behavior such as \u0026ldquo;forgetting\u0026rdquo; to take care of responsibilities around the house or, even worse, making \u0026ldquo;harmless jokes\u0026rdquo; about her to my friends.\nSo if emotions must be dealt with, then how should I do so? Should I simply scream at the wife anytime I feel angry? Of course not. I can consciously choose for myself how I will release these emotions, but doing so requires reflection and temperance. This is where prayer comes in. If I pray about the strong emotions I\u0026rsquo;m feeling, God and I can find healthy ways of expressing and releasing them. Oftentimes, simply consciously acknowledging them before God is enough of a release and nothing more is required. At other times I might need to take some concrete action. At those times I will have to discern what is the right action-what is God\u0026rsquo;s will for me. Returning to the example of spousal anger, it may be the case that acknowledging that anger before God is all that is needed. I may in my prayer time feel a sense of relief and release once I have talked it over with God. On the other hand, God might challenge me to deal with deeper problems at the root of my anger. God might reveal to me that the anger is an emotional problem I must come to terms with in my life. Or I might discern that my anger is pointing to an issue in my marriage that needs to be tended to by both my wife and me. God and I could discern then how best to approach my wife with this problem. Whatever the case may be, praying about the persistent emotions in my life will only help me to grow and become a more mature and loving person.\nThere is another related reason why it\u0026rsquo;s a great idea to pray with my emotions. The core of our Christian faith is our belief in an incarnate God. We believe that God loves us so much that he became one of us. He desired so much to be part of our lives that he stepped into the murky waters of humanity. Through Jesus Christ, he enters into the nitty-gritty of our lives. He is not satisfied with standing on the sidelines, cheering us when we score and bandaging us when we get hurt. No, God chooses to get in the game! And through the Holy Spirit, he chooses to get in my game. The Spirit of God wants to join me in all of my joys and sorrows, my quiet days and my raucous ones, too. But out of love, the Spirit of God respects my free will and does not enter where he is not invited. Praying over emotions, then, is saying yes to God\u0026rsquo;s offer to enter into my very heart. \u0026ldquo;Listen! I am at the door knocking,\u0026rdquo; says Jesus. \u0026ldquo;If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 3:20).\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/0.-introduction/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eINTRODUCTION\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, \u0026ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.\u0026rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I\u0026rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life. I might be filled with joy returning from a family camping trip, or I might be seething with anger about an argument I\u0026rsquo;ve just had with my best friend. I might have my dying grandmother in mind, or I simply might want to relax in the stillness of the evening. Often I have a strong sense that God is calling me to bring this mood or situation to our quiet time together. But often, I feel the need for a customized \u0026ldquo;prayer starter\u0026rdquo;: a Bible passage that deals with my current mood, a short reflection I can use to begin my conversation with God, a concrete suggestion about how to pray in this particular situation or a pithy quote I can easily memorize and carry with me as I exit my prayer and enter my day. Sitting in my prayer chair with coffee mug in hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I wish I had a book in which I could look up the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in today to get me started on my prayer.\u0026rdquo; Searching long and hard for such a book and not finding one, I decided that I ought to take Langford\u0026rsquo;s advice and write one myself. God, I Have Issues is not intended to be read from cover to cover. It is a reference manual to help you bring the stuff of your life into your daily prayer time. The concept is simple: using the various indexes in the back of the book, find the entry that best fits your situation or mood. You can read the entire entry in the first few minutes of your prayer time and plan your prayer accordingly, meditating on one of the suggested Scriptures, pondering the reflection or trying out one of the prayer pointers. In the days that follow, you can use the \u0026ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages\u0026rdquo; section to continue your reflections. If you\u0026rsquo;re still needing more, or if this entry does not quite fit your particular situation, you can check out the suggestions from the \u0026ldquo;Related Entries\u0026rdquo; section. Finally, you can memorize or scribble down a quote from the \u0026ldquo;Words to Take with You\u0026rdquo; section so that you can return to prayer at quiet moments in your day. Some of the quotes are profound and thought provoking, some are just downright silly. But I hope you will find them to be a helpful way of bringing you back to the reflective state of your earlier prayer time.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"0. Introduction"}]
