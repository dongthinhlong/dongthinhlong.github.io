[{"content":"GOD, I NEED TO CONFRONT SOMEONE Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one\u0026rsquo;s foes will be members of one\u0026rsquo;s own household. -Matthew 10:34-36\nAs a Christian, I am called to win over hearts and minds to Christ. But I am more often called to do so with gentle cajoling than with angry confrontation. There are two major problems with confrontation. First, if I am honest with myself, I will see that my confrontation is often rooted in my own anger rather than in Christian love. Second, in the promotion of Christian values and ideals, confrontation is often an ineffective tool. It causes the person being confronted to be defensive of the status quo rather than open to new ideas or new ways of life. If, however, I couch my words in unconditional love and acceptance, then that person will feel less threatened by the challenge to change. The old adage is true: I can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\nThere are times, however, when the most loving thing to do is to openly confront someone. If I feel inclined to do so, then I must spend a lot of time in prayer, discerning whether this is truly God\u0026rsquo;s will. I must thoroughly explore my motives and my plan of action. I must also spiritually prepare myself for rejection and perhaps even hatred. Archbishop Oscar Romero, because he opposed the massacres conducted by the El Salvadoran military, knew that it was only a matter of time before he would be assassinated. Jesus had a strong sense of what was ahead for him as he prayed in the garden of Gethsemane about his inevitable crucifixion. Luke tells us, \u0026ldquo;In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.\u0026rdquo; In my personal experience, however (and it seems to be so in the experience of Jesus and of Romero as well), I have discovered that a certain peace can be drawn from the knowledge that I am doing my best, and that since this is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s work, I can trust that the Lord will take good care of me. J. Lubbock has a very simple statement about this: \u0026ldquo;When we have done our best, we should await the result in peace.\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t say how many times I have drawn strength from this little maxim. During the times when I feel called by God to do something unpleasant, this statement becomes a sort of mantra for me. I whisper it to my anxious heart over and over again not only in my prayer times but throughout the difficult days. I often find that the peace I draw from that mantra is contagious-that it spreads to all of the others involved. Even those on the receiving end of the confrontation or bad news seem to be affected by my demeanor of quiet serenity. Through that peace, I have found that I am better able to convey my sincere love for that person, which hopefully is the root of my unpleasant words and actions.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES EXODUS 3:4-14: God calls Moses to confront Pharaoh\n2 SAMUEL 12:1-13: Nathan confronts David\nPSALM 27: Though war rise up against me, yet I will be confident\nJEREMIAH 1:15-19: Jeremiah sent to confront the nations\nJEREMIAH 20:7-18: I could not keep quiet\nMATTHEW 7:1-5: Don\u0026rsquo;t judge others\nMATTHEW 18:15-20: If someone has a problem\nMATTHEW 23:1-39: Jesus versus the Pharisees\nMARK 8:31-33: Jesus to Peter: \u0026ldquo;Get away from me, Satan\u0026rdquo;\nLUKE 2:22-35: A sword will pierce your soul\nLUKE 9:44-62: The Son of Man will be betrayed\nLUKE 12:1-12: When they bring you before the authorities\nLUKE 12:49-59: I have not come to bring peace, but division!\nLUKE 21:12-19: Dark days are coming\nLUKE 22:31-34: I have prayed for you, Peter\nROMANS 8:26-39: What can separate us from the love of Christ?\nGALATIANS 2:11-14: Paul publicly confronts Peter\nGALATIANS 6:1-10: If someone is in sin, gently set him right\n1 PETER 3:8-17: Be prepared to give an account for the hope that is in you\nPRAYER POINTERS I use Lubbock\u0026rsquo;s quote as my mantra in prayer.

Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you. When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart, I will let you find me, says the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile. -Jeremiah 29:11-14\nYears ago, during a particularly difficult period of transition, I found myself praying the rosary a bit more than usual. In the midst of it one day, I realized why it was such a comfort to me. I prayed the rosary while trying to adjust to a new assignment because the rosary brought me back home. It brought me back to the place I felt most stable and secure: my childhood. My memories of praying the rosary with my family are almost palpable. I remember all of us kneeling on the wooden floor of the living room of our small wood-frame house on West Keller Street. I remember the tiny candlelight and the darkness surrounding it. I remember the feel of the rosary beads between my fingers and the sound of the cadences of Hail Marys, Our Fathers and Glory Be to the Fathers. I returned to the rosary during that time of transition because the rosary, and all those other Catholic rituals, were an important link between my past and present.\nThere is a quiet little gesture that the priest performs in the middle of the Mass that many Catholics probably don\u0026rsquo;t always notice. Just after the Lamb of God, the priest breaks a tiny piece of the host and drops it into the chalice. Legend has it that this ritual goes all the way back to the early church. Before there were priests, only bishops could consecrate the bread and wine. But before long there were so many Christians in the city that they could not handle all the crowds, so the new office of the priesthood was established. In the beginning the people were afraid of change-they did not believe that a priest had the authority to consecrate. So young men stood by during the bishop\u0026rsquo;s Mass, and just after the consecration, the bishop handed each of them a small piece of the host. They ran all through the city dropping the small pieces into the chalices of the priests\u0026rsquo; Masses. This symbolic gesture taught the people that there is only one Sacrifice of the Mass in which we all participate. We still do this liturgical gesture today to remind us of the same lesson. It reminds us that the Mass I celebrate in Houston is the same Mass my family is celebrating in my hometown in Louisiana. It\u0026rsquo;s the same Mass my Jesuit friend is celebrating in Siberia, the same Mass as is celebrated in every place I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had to say good-bye to. It\u0026rsquo;s the same Mass as the pope\u0026rsquo;s in Rome, and it\u0026rsquo;s the same Eternal Banquet that is celebrated by all my loved ones and ancestors who have gone ahead of me to heaven.\nWhen I am going through a difficult period of change in my life, I seek the consolation of those ancient rituals that remind me of my God and Savior, who is beyond all change. On the foundation of that rock, all earthly change is manageable.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 12:1-9: The call of Abraham\nISAIAH 42:1-16: Sing a new song\nISAIAH 43:16-21: Look, I am doing something new\nISAIAH 65:17-25: A new heaven and a new earth\nJEREMIAH 18: The potter\nJEREMIAH 29:11-14: I know the plans I have for you\nMATTHEW 1:18-25: Joseph\u0026rsquo;s dream\nMATTHEW 7:24-27: Build your house on rock\nLUKE 1:26-56: Mary\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;\nLUKE 5:36-38: Old wine, new wineskins\nLUKE 19:1-10: Come down, Zacchaeus\nJOHN 20:19-20: The apostles in the upper room, hiding\nACTS 10:9-33: Peter accepts \u0026ldquo;unclean\u0026rdquo; food for the first time\nPRAYER POINTERS I reflect on Cardinal Newman\u0026rsquo;s words below. I ponder the fact that I must allow change in my life if I am to continue to grow. I reflect on the ways that this particular change might help me to grow. I ask God to show me the many graces God can give me only if I say \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to this change.\nI prayerfully look back at my past and see that the times I have accepted changes in my life have been some of the most enriching and maturing moments of my life. I trust that God will make this change a grace-filled one as well.\nIn prayer I try to get to the root of my fear. What is the worst-case scenario here? In the light of prayer I realize that most of my fears are unfounded. I allow my objective mind to console my frightened and irrational heart. Even for those fears that may become a reality, I prayerfully recognize that God will always be there to protect me and keep me from harm. I place that trust in God.\nDuring periods of transition, I rely on the ancient prayers and rituals of the church to remind me that, while my life is changing, I can put my trust in the Unchanging One.

At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, \u0026lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.\u0026rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, \u0026lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.\u0026rsquo; Another said, \u0026lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.\u0026rdquo; -Luke 14:16-19\nGod wills that I work hard and contribute to the progress of humanity. But God does not will for me to be too busy. If I am too busy, then I am not taking care of the body, mind and spirit that God has entrusted to me. Nor am I doing any favors to those I serve, since I am not truly giving my healthiest, holiest, happiest self. So, while there may be brief periods when I must endure an overwhelming schedule, I should not allow myself to be in a permanent state of being overwhelmed with tasks to perform. If I do find myself in such a state, I must first admit that this is the result of choices that I made. I simply bit off more than I could chew. I said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to more things than I could handle. The solution would be for me to learn to say \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; If this has been a problem for a while, then I need to explore in prayer what my motivation is for hurting myself this way.\nOne motivation may be that I am addicted to work. Just as I could misuse alcohol, drugs and food, so, too, could I misuse God\u0026rsquo;s gift of work. A second motivation may be that I simply don\u0026rsquo;t love myself enough to take good care of myself. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself as the precious and fragile gift that I am. A third motivation may be that of arrogance. It is arrogant of me to think that I must be the one to solve everyone\u0026rsquo;s problems. It is humble of me to admit my limitations and my inability to be the savior of anything. A hardworking priest who was taking some time off from his busy job was stopped on the street by an alcoholic, homeless man. The man told the priest about his many serious problems and asked him for money. The priest looked at him with sincere compassion and said, \u0026ldquo;I see that you have very real and very serious problems, and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for that. But I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that I\u0026rsquo;m the one who can help you with those problems right now. All that I can do is promise to pray for you.\u0026rdquo; This priest was not selfish or uncaring; he simply knew his limitations and was humble enough to admit it to himself and to the homeless man. But you can imagine what the homeless guy thought of the priest! Which brings up a fourth motivation for not being able to say \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; Very often, I am not strong enough to take others\u0026rsquo; rejection of me. I feel guilty because someone else is angry or disappointed with me. But in order to live a happy, healthy, holy life I must accept that I will at times disappoint or anger others. There are simply no other options if I wish to care for myself in the way that God wills.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1:1-2:4: God created the heavens and the earth, then God rested\nPSALM 62: My soul rests in God alone\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nECCLESIASTES 1:1-2:26: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nMATTHEW 11:28-30: Come to me, all you who are weary\nMATTHEW 24:36-51: We do not know the day or the hour\nMARK 6:30-33: Come away awhile\nLUKE 9:57-62: Let me bury my father first\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things\nLUKE 14:15-24: Dinner guests are too busy to accept the invitation\nLUKE 16:19-31: The rich man and Lazarus\nPRAYER POINTERS Sometimes God asks me to do overwhelmingly difficult work. At other times, I simply have taken on more work than I should have. My first task in prayer, then, is to discern whether this busyness is God\u0026rsquo;s will or if it is simply my problem of overloading myself with work.\nIf it is God\u0026rsquo;s will for me right now, then I beg God for the strength to endure. I join my sufferings to Jesus\u0026rsquo; ordeal of the Passion. In that light, I see that God is not asking of me anything that his Son did not himself endure. I see that my task is puny compared to Jesus\u0026rsquo; most difficult work. I draw strength from knowing that my God is with me and has preceded me.\nIf it is my problem of overburdening myself, then I must explore the roots of this problem. Why is it that I have done this to myself? Is this a pattern in my life? Am I addicted to work? Do I love myself enough to take good care of myself? Do I arrogantly see myself as the only one who can solve these problems?\nI prayerfully consider if there are one or more tasks that God would like me to let go of at this time. I pray for the courage and strength it will take for me to admit to others that I simply can\u0026rsquo;t handle this right now. I spiritually prepare myself for the consequences, knowing that God will be with me through it all.

My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed. -Psalm 139:14-16\nOne lazy summer day a couple of years ago, I was playing with my nephews, Cameron and Dillon. They were taking turns doing tricks on Cameron\u0026rsquo;s new scooter. It looked easy to ride (famous last words), so I said, \u0026ldquo;Let me give it a try.\u0026rdquo; It took about twenty seconds for me to flip over the thing, careening into the mud. Afterward, I noticed that I had a fairly large cut on my leg from my wipeout. I cleaned it up and forgot about it.\nA few days later, I spent five days alone in the hill country of Texas so that I could write without distraction. During those reflective days, I was unusually observant of the healing process of that cut. I watched in awe as the cut grew uglier and more \u0026ldquo;colorful,\u0026rdquo; then gradually more natural- looking and harmless. One day I noticed perfectly smooth and unblemished pink skin all around it. It stirred me to consider the ease with which my body could recover from injury and \u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo; entirely new and perfect parts of itself. Now, weeks later, there is only the tiniest of scars left. A part of me wonders if my body could have gotten rid of even the scar but chose to keep it around in order to remind me that I\u0026rsquo;m a little too old now for scooters!\nI have always been fascinated by the phenomenon of homeostasis, the body\u0026rsquo;s ability to maintain balance and equilibrium in all of its systems. Many bodily functions that we consider problems are actually solutions from the perspective of the body. It is the body, not the disease, that causes fever. It does so because many bacteria cannot survive at higher temperatures. The body causes vomiting when it detects poison in the system and wants to flush itself clean. Sometimes headaches occur because the body, sensing that oxygen levels in the brain are a little low, rushes more of it upward. Homeostasis also refers to the unbelievable ability to keep my body temperature almost precisely the same whether I go for a run in the eleven-degree cold of Cambridge, Massachusetts, or in the ninety-one- degree heat of Houston, Texas. Now, how can that be? How can I be created so marvelously? It takes my breath away just to think about what an amazing wonder is this clumsy, beat-up, slightly overweight body of mine. When I praise the Lord, I do so for the gifts of family, vocation, friends, granted favors and undeserved graces. But how often do I sit in awe of the giftedness of my thumb, of the industry of my digestive system, of the particularity of my pinky-toe?\nI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

A cushioned chair that forces me to sit up straight usually does the trick. In the long run, breathing is easier and more relaxed when I\u0026rsquo;m sitting up. I sit quietly a few moments, allowing my breathing to slow down and my body to relax.\nWithout moving and in that same quiet state, I focus all of my attention on the big toe of my right foot. I \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; the presence of that toe as I never have before. I feel its contentment with simply \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; there at the end of my foot. In my heart I say to God repeatedly, \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Lord.\u0026rdquo; After a while, I move on to my entire right foot. I note its peacefulness and tranquility-its lack of anxiety or fear. I say again, \u0026ldquo;Thank you, Lord.\u0026rdquo; I now allow its partner, the left foot, into the reflection, noting its quietness and thanking God for creating it. I slowly move up past my feet and focus on the solitude of the shin. I continue moving slowly up my body, noting at each stage how peaceful and content each body part is and thanking God for it. I do this exercise very slowly, spending a while at each spot without becoming stuck on any one.\nWhen I have reached the top of my head, I pull away slowly and try to get a sense of my entire body as a \u0026ldquo;unified whole\u0026rdquo; at rest and at peace.

I must be the one to stop the speeding train from careening over a cliff, and the only way to do so is to crash into it head-on myself. As a teacher, a parent, a friend, a leader, a citizen, a church member, I am sometimes called to stand up and turn over the tables of the moneychangers. The only good motive for ever doing so is love. I decide that the most loving thing that I can do at this moment is to destroy the comfortable godless world in which people are dwelling.\nBut those times are rare. Most of the time when I blow up, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve lost control of my own passions, and I explode like an erupted pressure cooker. Why do people explode in anger? A friend of mine who is active in Alcoholics Anonymous taught me the H.A.L.T. formula. She said, \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re about to blow up and do something stupid, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to H.A.L.T. and ask yourself, \u0026lsquo;Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired?\u0026rsquo; Once you\u0026rsquo;ve determined which of these four is the problem, you can work on fixing that relatively simple need rather than losing control and behaving destructively.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom another perspective, science tells us that every species of animal in the world generally reacts to perceived threats in one of two ways: fight or flight. When I\u0026rsquo;m courageous enough to pray about my outbursts of anger, I often discover that the motive behind the outburst was not love at all but rather some unacknowledged fear deep inside me. Often, when I explode, it\u0026rsquo;s because, far below the level of consciousness, I feel terribly threatened, and I am desperately trying to save myself.\nShould this be the case, then, in my prayer, as I look back on my outburst, I must courageously allow Jesus to ask me, \u0026ldquo;What did you feel threatened by?\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a tough question to face. If I exploded emotionally, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because of a deep-seated pain. It will not reveal its frightened self easily. I will have to approach it gingerly, carefully, slowly. I must beg God to give me the strength and the courage to face this wound with integrity and humility. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve confronted my threatened self, I can then ask Christ to begin the slow process of healing me. On a practical level, I can seek ways to feel more secure in similar situations.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 4:1-15: Cain kills Abel\nPSALM 103: The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nPROVERBS 14:17: A quick tempered man does foolish things\nISAIAH 2:2-5: They shall beat their swords into plowshares\nMATTHEW 5:21-26: Everyone who grows angry shall be liable to judgment\nMATTHEW 5:38-43: Love your enemies\nMATTHEW 21:18-22: Jesus curses the fig tree\nMATTHEW 26:47-56: The one who lives by the sword shall die by the sword\nMARK 11:15-19: Jesus cleanses the temple\nLUKE 9:51-56: Jesus chides the apostles about their revenge\nJOHN 2:13-25: Jesus and the moneychangers\nACTS 15: Paul and Barnabas fight and split\nROMANS 12:17-21: \u0026ldquo;Vengeance is mine,\u0026rdquo; says the Lord\nEPHESIANS 4:25-32: Do not let the sun go down on your anger\nJAMES 3: No one can tame the tongue-a restless evil, full of poison\nPRAYER POINTERS As painful as it is to do so, I pray for those who hurt me and for those whom I have hurt. I ask the Lord to bless these people with his abundant love and grace.\nIf I have blown up recently, it would be good for me to practice stillness in my prayer. I should ask the Lord for the grace of inner peace. Praying over Psalm 131 or using a mantra such as \u0026ldquo;Still me, O Lord\u0026rdquo; might help.\nSometimes I discover in my prayer that I feel threatened by a particular person. In my journal, I write him or her a letter that I never intend to send. That way, I can be uncensored in laying down my own vulnerability and fear. The purpose of this letter is not to reconcile with the person, but rather to get in touch with my own fear. By addressing the letter to the person whom I fear, I am beginning the slow process of facing him or her. After I have written the letter, I should read it aloud to Jesus and ask him for consolation and healing. Only then can Jesus and I begin to discern how to reconcile with that person.\nAfter praying over the question, \u0026ldquo;What am I threatened by?\u0026rdquo;, I might also explore the following questions: \u0026ldquo;Would it be appropriate for me to attempt to reconcile with those I may have hurt? If so, how? Am I ready to forgive myself for losing it? Do those I\u0026rsquo;ve hurt know that I love them? Is there an appropriate way of expressing my love at this time?\u0026rdquo;\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace.\nWhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nGrant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love.\nit is in giving that we receive;\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned;\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.\n-Peace Prayer of Saint Francis\nRELATED ENTRIES Angry, Confront, Guilty, Hurt by Others, Judgmental, Marriage, Sinned\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Sure the world breeds monsters, but kindness grows just as wild.\n-Mary Karr\nBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.\n-Plato\nBetter to remain silent and appear stupid, than to speak and eliminate all doubt.\n-Anonymous\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/6.-god-i-blew-up-today/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCain said to his brother Abel, \u0026ldquo;Let us go out to the field.\u0026rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.

Saint Francis of Assisi\nEveryone in the course of a lifetime experiences rare and wonderful epiphanies in nature when God momentarily lifts the veil of our unknowing and shows us his face. Here\u0026rsquo;s one of mine:\nJanuary, 2000\nAt approximately six o\u0026rsquo;clock this morning, I put on my running gear and ran six miles along the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The temperature was in the upper teens or lower twenties! I almost turned around at several points in the first few minutes of the run. My hands were so cold that I had to keep twirling my fingers just to keep the circulation going. My strange high-tech running suit managed to cover practically every part of me. But there was a small, one-inch triangle of flesh at the bottom of my neck where the zipper of my suit did not come all the way up to meet my ski mask. In that biting cold, I was introduced to this small spot on my body that I had never noticed before. When I reached the frozen river, I saw the Boston skyline in a gradually more oranging sky and was grateful that I had not turned around and missed this. A little farther on, the trail left Storrow Drive and went through a park area where all I saw were trees on my right and the river on my left. While running beside it, I spent a while observing the thin sheet of ice that had formed on the surface of the river. Twenty minutes into the run, I emerged from a particularly engrossing and absorbing conversation with God to realize to my great surprise that I was no longer cold. All body parts were warm and comfortable even my newfound little spot! I was awestruck at my body\u0026rsquo;s ability to regulate its own temperature, even in these conditions. Fifty minutes into the run, I had come full circle and was home again-happy that it was over, but a little sad, too. Like Adam in the fresco on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, for just a moment I felt the touch of God on my flesh.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s your story?\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1:1-2:4: The creation story\nJOB 38-41: The Lord speaks of his creation\nPSALM 8: The Lord\u0026rsquo;s majesty\nPSALM 29: The God of glory thunders over mighty waters\nPSALM 104: Bless the Lord, O my soul\nPSALM 145: One generation shall laud your works to another\nDANIEL 3:52-90: All things bless the Lord\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nCOLOSSIANS 1:3-20: By him, all things were created\nPRAYER POINTERS If I am currently experiencing one of these moments of epiphany with nature, then I bask in the wonder of it. I stay with that moment as long as possible. I sit in the leaves, climb the tree, wade in the river. Through it all, I recognize the Creator\u0026rsquo;s presence in the very essence of his creation, and I praise God for it.\nI read slowly through Daniel 3:52-90 and then write my own stanzas to reflect my own personal experience (for example, \u0026ldquo;Leaf and tree, praise the Lord. Mockingbird and mosquito, praise the Lord\u0026rdquo;).\nI record this moment in my journal. I write a poem or a song about it. I paint a picture or mold a sculpture with clay. I take some memento of the moment (a leaf, a pebble) and place it next to my computer or on the kitchen windowsill; I allow that little object to take me back to the place several times throughout my day.\nI respond to God\u0026rsquo;s awesome gift of creation by letting God know how overwhelmed I am by its beauty and grace.

But is this an image of an all-loving God? Would I want such a person as a friend? A spouse? A teacher? A parent? God is not like this at all. If I want a good image of God, I should think of the most loving and compassionate person in my life and imagine God to be infinitely more loving and compassionate. Furthermore, God desires that we have an intimate relationship with him. And because I am human, I naturally will have problems in this relationship. I will get angry with God as I sometimes get angry with my spouse, my friend, my parents and so on.\nThe Bible is filled with examples of friends of God who at one time or another got angry with him. Sarah cynically laughed at God\u0026rsquo;s promise that she and Abraham would have a child in their old age. Jacob wrestled with an angel for a blessing. The Israelites in the desert complained about the food. In the New Testament, though Jesus was divine, his best friends often argued with him. Here are a few examples:\n\u0026ldquo;Lord, we have been fishing all day and have caught nothing. Now you\u0026rsquo;re telling us to go back out there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;OK, fine. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to Jerusalem to die with Jesus.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you had been here, Lazarus would not have died.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not care, Lord, that we\u0026rsquo;re all going to die?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lord, if we have no idea where you are going, how can we follow?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I have to die for you Lord, will your beloved disciple have to die, too?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Jesus himself, at the most important moment of his life, shouted at God, \u0026ldquo;My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps the best example of a healthy conflict with God is that of Old Testament hero Job, who for chapters and chapters shook his fist at God. Biblical scholars say that the vocabulary of much of Job\u0026rsquo;s ranting implies that Job actually wanted to take God to court. He wanted to convict God in a heavenly court of law. When Job made that seemingly beautiful statement, \u0026ldquo;I know that my Redeemer lives\u0026rdquo; (Job 19:25), he actually was referring to a heavenly being who could help him to convict God in this celestial trial!\nIn every one of these examples, God remained faithful and did not condemn the angry follower. At times God fought back, but only when it would help the person to grow. Sarah bore a child and became the mother of the Judeo-Christian world. Jacob got his blessing. The Israelites were given the Promised Land. Peter became pope. And Job, having lost his court battle, was blessed with riches and great wisdom.\nSo, if you have a beef with God, what are you waiting for?

And they seemed to have no trouble letting God know that they were angry! With this assurance, I go after God. I sit him in the chair in front of me and I let him have it, telling him every little thing that is bothering me about him right now. I hold nothing back and say everything that comes to mind.\nIf I feel more comfortable doing so, I write God a nasty letter giving him a piece of my mind. Point by point, I spell out all the ways I feel that he has screwed up my life. Again, I hold nothing back.\nThroughout my ranting, I imagine God sitting quietly and listening with great care and great love. When I have exhausted myself with all that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to say, I sit quietly and allow God to respond. I let God say or do anything he wants. Perhaps he will reach out to embrace me. Perhaps he will respond to my particular problems, pointing out his logic. Perhaps he will simply ask me to trust. Perhaps he will yell back! Perhaps he will remain silent and distant.\nI respond to God in whatever way feels natural. I may need to yell some more. I may need to melt in his arms. I may need to keep my distance for a while. I may need to ask questions. I allow myself to say or do whatever my heart leads me to do.\nIf I am really angry with God, there is a good chance that I will have to pray about this for a long time. At the end of each prayer time, I tell God that I love him and accept his will for me in my life and trust that his will is always what is best for me. If my heart cannot say these words right now, I let my own will do the talking for me.\nRELATED ENTRIES Angry, Dry, Grieving, Ministry\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU I chased him until he caught me.\n-Anonymous\nDear Lord, if this is how you treat your friends, it is no wonder you have so few!\n-Saint Teresa of Avila\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/4.-god-im-angry-at-you/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThose who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, \u0026ldquo;Aha!

On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \u0026ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\u0026rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village. (Luke 9:51-55)\nI have righteous anger when I have been unjustifiably wronged and am justifiably angry about it. In and of itself, righteous anger is amoral; it is neither sinful nor virtuous. It has some good qualities. For example, it was righteous anger that led Candy Lightner, an angry mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver, to start the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which works to end drunk driving in America. But righteous anger can be dangerous. Psychologically speaking, it is a defense mechanism I use to give me power when I feel powerless in the face of some evil done to me. If I\u0026rsquo;m not careful, I can become addicted to the power it brings me. I can stew in the delicious strength I feel from the rage inside me. If I do not ultimately let it go, it will consume me over time.\nIf anyone had a right to have righteous anger, it would be the crucified Jesus. He was purely innocent and yet died a savage and brutal death. But instead of being angry, as he hangs in excruciating pain, Jesus cries out, \u0026ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u0026rdquo; Spiritual writer Thomas Hart humorously points out that, for the apostles, the appearance of the resurrected Jesus might not necessarily be a good thing. After all, how would you feel if the friend that you had betrayed and abandoned came back from the dead to see you? Jesus had every right to be furious with his apostles to say, \u0026ldquo;Where were you? After all I\u0026rsquo;ve done for you!\u0026rdquo; But instead, Jesus granted them amnesty: \u0026ldquo;Peace is my gift to you,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nPerhaps this is part of what it means to be resurrected: to relinquish one\u0026rsquo;s right to be angry and to wish and work for peace on earth and good will toward all, even toward one\u0026rsquo;s perpetrators. Until we reach this point, we will still be mortally wounded. The New Testament says that God the Father raised Jesus from the dead. If this is true about Jesus, this will certainly be true for us, too. We cannot resurrect ourselves; we must let God raise us. And like Jesus, we must spend some time in the tomb. We must wait for the gift to come.

I ask myself, \u0026ldquo;Who is the person whom I am most angry with at this moment? My brother? My spouse? My boss? Why am I angry with him or her? What am I feeling deep down in my heart about him or her?\u0026rdquo; I do not settle on the first answers that I come up with. I keep probing- asking myself these questions until I feel I have reached the core of the issues.\nI then imagine that very person sitting in one of the empty chairs. I imagine this person telling me everything he or she is feeling about me and about the present situation. I imagine this person speaking without fear, anxiety or embarrassment. What would he or she say? I listen quietly and attentively to the words spoken.\nI now share with this person what I have discovered are my deep emotions right now. I imagine myself without fear, anxiety or embarrassment and able to say exactly what I am feeling. If I need to yell and scream at him or her for a while, I go for it. Again, I say exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling without any censorship.\nI now notice Jesus sitting in the third chair and listening intently to our conversation. I ask him to share with me his feelings about this situation. What does he say? Is he happy? Disappointed? Does he have some insight the other two of us haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of? What is my response? How should my attitude and actions toward this person change because of this encounter with Jesus? I allow a three-way conversation to continue, allowing everyone a chance to say anything he or she wishes.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m really angry right now, I may have to pray about this for a while. Each time I pray this prayer time, I end it by telling this person that I love him or her regardless of how I feel right now.

For example, if I feel frightened by the notion of speaking out against some unjust practice at work, I\u0026rsquo;ll want to ask myself, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of? Rejection by my peers? Rejection by my superiors? Am I afraid of conflict itself? Am I afraid of losing my job?\u0026rdquo;\nEach day that I pray over this situation, I want to dig deeper into my fears. Each time I ask the question, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of?\u0026rdquo;, I should try to discover a deeper answer. Using the example above, I may discover after a number of prayer times that I am afraid of my boss. I then want to ask myself again, \u0026ldquo;What is it about my boss that I\u0026rsquo;m really afraid of?\u0026rdquo; І may then discover that my boss reminds me of my overbearing mother who disciplined me through fear. Or, I may feel a need to impress my boss and am afraid to get on her bad side. Or, I may realize that I feel my job is constantly threatened that the boss could fire me at any moment. If losing my job is the fear, I may come back and ask the question again, \u0026ldquo;What is it I\u0026rsquo;m really afraid of?\u0026rdquo; I may discover that beneath the fear of losing my job is a terrible fear of being an inadequate father. Now we\u0026rsquo;re getting somewhere! But I haven\u0026rsquo;t arrived at this root cause of my fear until after I have spent a great deal of time in prayer, asking myself again and again, \u0026ldquo;What am I really afraid of?\u0026rdquo;\nThe next step, of course, would be to allow Jesus to enter that scary place with me. My friend Paul once told me of a prayer experience whereby he and Jesus were walking through the many rooms of his house-a metaphor for his very self. After a while they came to a locked door that represented Paul\u0026rsquo;s most frightening parts of himself, and he said to Jesus, \u0026ldquo;Sorry, Lord, I can\u0026rsquo;t let you in that door.\u0026rdquo; For several prayer times more, Paul reflected on how much of his emotional and spiritual life is spent guarding that door -keeping everyone, including Jesus and even himself, from entering it. You can imagine the liberation Paul finally experienced when he gathered up the courage to walk into that room with Jesus.\nI must do the same. I must take Jesus\u0026rsquo; hand and walk into my own dark, cobwebbed room. I sit on the floor awhile with him and get a feel for this place I\u0026rsquo;ve run from for so long. I let Jesus light a candle, so that we can see it clearly and describe it to one another. Now that the light is on, is this place so scary after all?\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES\n1 SAMUEL 17:32-51: David and Goliath\nPSALM 23: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\nPSALM 27: The Lord is my light and my salvation\nPSALM 56: When I\u0026rsquo;m afraid, I put my trust in you\nPSALM 62: My soul rests in God alone\nPSALM 69: Save me, O God\nPSALM 91: He will rescue you from the snare of the fowler\nPSALM 118: The Lord is with me; I fear not\nISAIAH 25:4-26:4: The Lord is an eternal rock\nISAIAH 41:1-10: Fear not, for I am with you\nISAIAH 43:1-8: You will walk through fire, and not be burned\nMATTHEW 10:16-20: Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about what to say\nMATTHEW 14:22-33: Jesus rescues the apostles from the stormy sea\nMARK 5:21-43: Fear is useless-what is needed is faith\nMARK 10:27: All things are possible with God\nMARK 16:1-8: The women fled from the tomb\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha, you are anxious about many things\nLUKE 22:40-46: Jesus sweats blood in the garden of Gethsemane\nJOHN 20:19-23: The resurrected Christ says, \u0026ldquo;Peace be with you\u0026rdquo;\nACTS 4:1-31: The Holy Spirit comes to help Peter\nROMANS 8:28-39: All things work together for the good\n2 CORINTHIANS 12:7-10: My grace is sufficient for you\n1 PETER 5:6-11: Cast all your cares on him, for he cares for you\n1 JOHN 4:18: Cast out all fear\nPRAYER POINTERS\nI allow Jesus and me to explore ever deeper levels of the roots of my fear.

They provide the impetus I need to finally surrender my life to God. My addiction is \u0026ldquo;exhibit A\u0026rdquo; among my proofs for why I can\u0026rsquo;t manage the job of being my own savior. I have many other proofs, but this one is the most convincing. Without my addiction, I could almost convince myself that I don\u0026rsquo;t need a savior. But try as I might, no matter what I do, no matter how many degrees I get, or how many friends I have, or how many promises I make, or how many times a day I pray, I cannot get a handle on my addiction. I am powerless over it. I will need a higher power to rescue me from it.\nSome of the happiest, healthiest, holiest people I know are alcoholics who speak freely of their addiction. It is as though they have found some sort of freedom in being able to say, \u0026ldquo;I give up. I can\u0026rsquo;t handle it, and I won\u0026rsquo;t fight it anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m an alcoholic: I am powerless in the face of alcohol.\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine the relief one must feel in being able to finally let go of the battles and ask Christ to be one\u0026rsquo;s champion. Many will even go so far as to say that they are grateful for their addiction, for it was through it that they found God and even found themselves. Sounds a lot like Saint Paul, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nI will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. (2 Corinthians 12:9)\nEvery one of us is an addict. Every one of us clings too tightly to one thing or another. If we\u0026rsquo;re not careful, our addictions will destroy us. They may flatten us quickly, or they may corrode our lives little by little, leaving us impotent and lifeless. That is, of course, if we choose not to use our addictions to lead us to the altar of Christ-the place where we Christians celebrate the broken body of our Lord. It is in that brokenness that we are made whole.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES EXODUS 32: The golden calf NUMBERS 11: Complaining in the desert JUDGES 16:4-31: Samson\u0026rsquo;s lust destroys him 1 KINGS 11: Solomon turns his heart to other gods EZEKIEL 37:1-14: God restores dry bones JOEL 2:15-3:2: Call to penance; the Lord responds MATTHEW 17:14-21: Casting out demons MATTHEW 19:16-30: The rich young man MARK 5:1-20: The healing of the demoniac MARK 5:21-43: Fear is useless-what is needed is faith MARK 10:46-52: The blind man Bartimaeus LUKE 12:13-21: Storing up earthly treasure LUKE 23:39-43: Jesus saves the good thief JOHN 4:1-39: The woman at the well JOHN 8:1-11: The woman being stoned JOHN 8:31-36: The truth will set you free ROMANS 7:14-25: What I want to do, I do not do 2 CORINTHIANS 4:7-18: We are afflicted but not crushed 2 CORINTHIANS 12:7-10: My grace is sufficient for you\nPRAYER POINTERS If I have not already done so, I pray over the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (see www.aa.org).

God, I'm Addicted"},{"content":"INTRODUCTION Speaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, \u0026ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.\u0026rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I\u0026rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life. I might be filled with joy returning from a family camping trip, or I might be seething with anger about an argument I\u0026rsquo;ve just had with my best friend. I might have my dying grandmother in mind, or I simply might want to relax in the stillness of the evening. Often I have a strong sense that God is calling me to bring this mood or situation to our quiet time together. But often, I feel the need for a customized \u0026ldquo;prayer starter\u0026rdquo;: a Bible passage that deals with my current mood, a short reflection I can use to begin my conversation with God, a concrete suggestion about how to pray in this particular situation or a pithy quote I can easily memorize and carry with me as I exit my prayer and enter my day. Sitting in my prayer chair with coffee mug in hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I wish I had a book in which I could look up the mood I\u0026rsquo;m in today to get me started on my prayer.\u0026rdquo; Searching long and hard for such a book and not finding one, I decided that I ought to take Langford\u0026rsquo;s advice and write one myself. God, I Have Issues is not intended to be read from cover to cover. It is a reference manual to help you bring the stuff of your life into your daily prayer time. The concept is simple: using the various indexes in the back of the book, find the entry that best fits your situation or mood. You can read the entire entry in the first few minutes of your prayer time and plan your prayer accordingly, meditating on one of the suggested Scriptures, pondering the reflection or trying out one of the prayer pointers. In the days that follow, you can use the \u0026ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages\u0026rdquo; section to continue your reflections. If you\u0026rsquo;re still needing more, or if this entry does not quite fit your particular situation, you can check out the suggestions from the \u0026ldquo;Related Entries\u0026rdquo; section. Finally, you can memorize or scribble down a quote from the \u0026ldquo;Words to Take with You\u0026rdquo; section so that you can return to prayer at quiet moments in your day. Some of the quotes are profound and thought provoking, some are just downright silly. But I hope you will find them to be a helpful way of bringing you back to the reflective state of your earlier prayer time.\nOne caution about this book: these entries are intended for psychologically healthy people going through the typical cycle of everyday emotions and situations. It is far beyond the scope of this book to deal with serious emotional or psychological problems. \u0026ldquo;God, I\u0026rsquo;m Sad,\u0026rdquo; for example, is written for the psychologically healthy person who happens to be sad today. A person who is clinically depressed will need to seek professional help and should not rely solely on this or any other spiritual or psychological book for recovery from this serious problem. The same holds for all of the other emotions mentioned in the book.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH THIS BOOK If you are new to meditation and contemplation, I recommend you take the following three steps:\nFind two or three good books that are introductions to this type of prayer. I recommend one of these: Green, Thomas. Opening to God. (Ave Maria Press, 1977.)\nHauser, Richard. In His Spirit. (Paulist Press, 1982.)\nKeating, Thomas. Intimacy with God. (Crossroad/Herder \u0026amp; Herder, 1996.)\nLink, Mark. The Challenge 2000 Series. (Thomas More Press, 1993.)\nThibodeaux, Mark. Armchair Mystic: Easing Into Contemplative Prayer. (St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001.)\nZanzig, Thomas. Learning to Meditate. (St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s Press, 1990.)\nFind a spiritual director, someone who has more experience in contemplation and mediation, who can guide you as you take your first steps and can help you maintain a healthy prayer life once you\u0026rsquo;ve been at it for a while. Find at least one or two peers with whom you can share your spiritual journeys, exchange insights, ideas and so on. Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple formula for using this book in a daily regimen of prayer:\nFind a quiet time and space in which to pray every day. Many pray-ers find the best time to pray to be the early morning and the best place to pray to be a chair that is comfortable but not so much so that one would fall asleep easily. Beside your chair, place whatever helps you to pray: a Bible, a candle, a journal and pen, a spiritual book.\nBefore beginning prayer, ask yourself what topic, emotion, issues or situation God and you might want to work with today. On some days nothing in particular will come to mind. You may want to pray over the liturgical readings of the day or simply have a cup of coffee with Jesus. On other days some particular mood, situation or issue might be very present to you. If so, look up the mood or situation in the book and quickly read over the entire entry. Place the book open-faced beside your chair.\nBegin to quiet yourself. Slow down your breathing. Settle down your thoughts. You might want to hum a simple religious tune or speak a mantra, a holy word or phrase, over and over again. For example, you might want to say the name \u0026ldquo;Jesus\u0026rdquo; very slowly over and over again. Allow yourself to sit in this holy stillness for as long as it feels comfortable.\nIf you feel yourself coming out of that stillness and if it feels right to do so, pick up this book and again skim the entire entry. When you find something that strikes you, ignore all the rest and focus on that one part. For example, if a particular Scripture passage looks appealing, look up that passage and pray over it for the entire prayer period. Or perhaps something in the reflection will strike you; then stay with that thought or insight and have a conversation with God about it. Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ll want to try out one of the \u0026ldquo;Prayer Pointers.\u0026rdquo;\nWhatever you choose to pray with, it is important that you do not clutter your prayer time with activities or even multiple Scripture passages. It is far better to focus on one small point, insight or passage than to jump from one spot to another.\nClose your prayer time with the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, the Glory Be to the Father or some other ready-made prayer. Before leaving your prayer spot, you might want to consider what you\u0026rsquo;ll pray over tomorrow. You might also memorize one of the quotes from \u0026ldquo;Words to Take with You\u0026rdquo; or scribble it on a slip of paper so that you can go back to it here and there during your day.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH SCRIPTURE Those who practice Christian meditation and contemplation find praying with Scriptures to be the bread and butter of their prayer life. Therefore, each entry provides a list of \u0026ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages.\u0026rdquo; In preparing to pray, you might want to peruse the list and look up the passages that seem promising. Settle down with one passage and bookmark that spot in your Bible before beginning to pray. That way you won\u0026rsquo;t have to distract yourself with finding the right passage and flipping to it during the prayer time itself.\nSaint Ignatius Loyola suggests that once you have found a passage that really works in prayer (that is, one that helps you get in touch with God), then you should stay with that passage for as long as it continues to work. If the passage really speaks to you or moves you closer to God, you might pray over the same passage again and again for several days or even weeks. The goal then is not to pray over every single passage relating to your mood or situation, but instead to pray deeply over one or, at most, a few passages.\nIn the same way that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to cover every passage, you might find it more helpful to focus on one small part of one passage. Psalm 139:1-18, for example, is a rich passage filled with many wonderful words, phrases and images. Instead of trying to cover them all in your prayer time, it would be better to choose the one word, phrase or image that speaks to you today and zero in on that one, leaving all the rest of it behind.\nHere are three concrete ways to meditate on Scripture:\nAsk a reflection question. Read the passage and think of a reflection question to discuss with God. Basically, ask God and yourself, \u0026ldquo;What is this passage about?\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;How does this relate to my life?\u0026rdquo;\nPlay a role in the story. Read the Bible story several times and, in your imagination, play the role of one of the characters in the story. Then have a talk with Jesus about what you experienced.\nUse a mantra. The mantra is a word, phrase or sentence that you repeat over and over. Simply pick your favorite line from the passage and very slowly, very prayerfully, say that word, phrase or sentence over and over again. Let it take root in your heart.\nABOUT PRAYING WITH EMOTIONS Why should I pray over my emotions? For the most part, emotions are amoral. That is to say, at least to the extent that I don\u0026rsquo;t choose the particular emotion I\u0026rsquo;m now experiencing, they are neither virtuous nor sinful. Very often, good people make the mistake of trying (either unconsciously or consciously) to repress emotions they consider \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sinful.\u0026rdquo; For example, if I were married, I may unconsciously hold to this fallacy: \u0026ldquo;I must suppress all feelings of anger toward my wife because good husbands feel love and affection for their spouses all the time.\u0026rdquo; The problem is that repressing or suppressing my emotions does not make them go away. On the contrary, strong emotions that are not dealt with straightforwardly will seek some sort of unconscious release. For example, unrepressed anger toward my spouse might lead me to passive-aggressive behavior such as \u0026ldquo;forgetting\u0026rdquo; to take care of responsibilities around the house or, even worse, making \u0026ldquo;harmless jokes\u0026rdquo; about her to my friends.\nSo if emotions must be dealt with, then how should I do so? Should I simply scream at the wife anytime I feel angry? Of course not. I can consciously choose for myself how I will release these emotions, but doing so requires reflection and temperance. This is where prayer comes in. If I pray about the strong emotions I\u0026rsquo;m feeling, God and I can find healthy ways of expressing and releasing them. Oftentimes, simply consciously acknowledging them before God is enough of a release and nothing more is required. At other times I might need to take some concrete action. At those times I will have to discern what is the right action-what is God\u0026rsquo;s will for me. Returning to the example of spousal anger, it may be the case that acknowledging that anger before God is all that is needed. I may in my prayer time feel a sense of relief and release once I have talked it over with God. On the other hand, God might challenge me to deal with deeper problems at the root of my anger. God might reveal to me that the anger is an emotional problem I must come to terms with in my life. Or I might discern that my anger is pointing to an issue in my marriage that needs to be tended to by both my wife and me. God and I could discern then how best to approach my wife with this problem. Whatever the case may be, praying about the persistent emotions in my life will only help me to grow and become a more mature and loving person.\nThere is another related reason why it\u0026rsquo;s a great idea to pray with my emotions. The core of our Christian faith is our belief in an incarnate God. We believe that God loves us so much that he became one of us. He desired so much to be part of our lives that he stepped into the murky waters of humanity. Through Jesus Christ, he enters into the nitty-gritty of our lives. He is not satisfied with standing on the sidelines, cheering us when we score and bandaging us when we get hurt. No, God chooses to get in the game! And through the Holy Spirit, he chooses to get in my game. The Spirit of God wants to join me in all of my joys and sorrows, my quiet days and my raucous ones, too. But out of love, the Spirit of God respects my free will and does not enter where he is not invited. Praying over emotions, then, is saying yes to God\u0026rsquo;s offer to enter into my very heart. \u0026ldquo;Listen! I am at the door knocking,\u0026rdquo; says Jesus. \u0026ldquo;If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 3:20).\n","permalink":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/0.-introduction/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eINTRODUCTION\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, \u0026ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.\u0026rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I\u0026rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life.
