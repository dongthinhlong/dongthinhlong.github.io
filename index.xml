      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lạy-chúa-con-có-những-nghi-ngờ&#34;&gt;Lạy Chúa, con có những nghi ngờ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Một người trong đám đông thưa lại: &amp;lsquo;Thưa Thầy, tôi đã đem con tôi đến cùng Thầy; nó bị thần câm ám. Hễ thần nhập vào, là vật nó xuống; nó sùi bọt mép, nghiến răng, rồi bất động. Tôi đã xin các môn đệ Thầy trừ giúp, nhưng các ông không làm được&amp;hellip; Nhiều lần, thần xô nó vào lửa, vào nước cho nó chết. Nhưng nếu Thầy làm được gì, xin thương chúng con mà giúp chúng con.&amp;rsquo; Chúa Giê-su nói: &amp;lsquo;Nếu Thầy làm được ư? Mọi sự đều có thể đối với người tin.&amp;rsquo; Lập tức, cha đứa bé kêu lên rằng: &amp;lsquo;Con tin; xin Thầy giúp lòng tin yếu kém của con!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; – Mc 9,17-18, 22-24&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>20. God, I&#39;m Grateful</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What may I give to the Lord for all the good things that he has done for me? I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord. I will make the offering of my oath to the Lord, even before all his people.&lt;/strong&gt; -Psalm 116:12-14 (Basic English translation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I watch my students eat lunch in the high school cafeteria, I sadly witness a great deal of waste. It would not be unusual for a boy to pull out an apple his mother packed for him, take a bite or two out of it, and throw the rest away. It brings to mind a story of an American missionary moving to a poor part of Central America. She brought an apple on the flight, but never got around to eating it. That afternoon, while unpacking in her new home, a neighborhood girl noticed the big beautiful apple in her bag. The missionary realized that the little girl was fascinated by the apple, so she gave it to her. The girl reverently held the apple in both of her hands and slowly walked out of the room, never taking her wonder-filled eyes off her gift. The missionary presumed that the girl went off somewhere to eat it, but she found out later that the girl took it back home, diced it, and walked around the impoverished neighborhood, giving everyone a taste of this rare and precious gift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>19. God, I Just Can&#39;t Forgive</title>
      <link>https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/19.-god-i-just-cant-forgive/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Peter came and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.&lt;/strong&gt; -Matthew 18:21-22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of forgiveness: forgiveness of the will and forgiveness of the heart. Forgiveness of the will is the choice to do all in my power, regardless of how I feel, to preserve and enhance the well-being of my offender. The all in my power part is important. Perhaps my anger will not yet allow me even to speak to my offender. Or perhaps I have discerned that it is not God&amp;rsquo;s will that I be in relationship with this person at this time (for example, a battered wife might discern that it is not God&amp;rsquo;s will for her to be with her husband anymore). Insofar as it is in my power to choose to forgive, I must forgive. That is what Christ teaches me to do. The choice part of that definition is important, too. Forgiveness of the will is a conscious choice that I make based on what I believe is God&amp;rsquo;s will for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>18. God, My Family Is Driving Me Nuts!</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When His own people heard of this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, &amp;ldquo;He has lost his senses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Mark 3:21 (NASB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of reasons why my family (which in my case is a religious community) might be driving me nuts. One reason may be that home is the only safe place for me to go nuts. That is, I know that they will accept me even if I do fly off the handle from time to time. In many ways, I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to &amp;ldquo;lose it&amp;rdquo; at work, in church or among friends. I may fear rejection from the people in those circles. So, I take my pent-up aggravation and anger home to the one place I know I can release it and still be loved and accepted. Meanwhile, my family members are doing the same with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>17. God, It&#39;s Evening</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.&amp;rdquo; For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.&lt;/strong&gt; -Mark 6:30-32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love the scene from the Bible passage above. Earlier, Jesus had sent the apostles off on their first mission by themselves. And things went well, very well. The apostles have returned, exhausted but thrilled with all of the wonders God worked through them. They can&amp;rsquo;t contain their joy, and all of them are talking at the same time as they tell Jesus all about their adventures. Jesus is smiling a paternal smile. He&amp;rsquo;s very proud and happy. &amp;ldquo;Come by yourselves to an out-of-the-way place,&amp;rdquo; he says. I can imagine the intimacy shared between them in this scene and the bond that now exists because of the accomplishment of common mission. The story in Mark goes on to say that the people loved them so much that they ran ahead to the not-so-hidden hiding place and were waiting for the apostles when they arrived. But at the very least, Jesus and the apostles had that quiet boat ride in the sunset. I can easily picture them drifting along on the placid waters, in no hurry to get any place. Three of them have fallen asleep. Peter can&amp;rsquo;t resist putting a fishing line in the water. Matthew hates being on the water and sits in the middle of the boat, nervously telling the others not to rock it too much. James and John are teasing him about this and are rocking the boat even more, which makes Jesus laugh out loud. And all the while, despite their exhaustion, they can&amp;rsquo;t help telling each other stories about all the ways God worked through their hands and feet and words and actions. They are drunk on joy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for me, I feel that the last drops of my life are being poured out for God. The time for my departure has arrived. The glorious fight that God gave me I have fought, the course that I was set I have finished, and I have kept the faith. The future for me holds the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the true judge, will give to me in that day.&lt;/strong&gt; -2 Timothy 4:6-8 (Modern English translation)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O, that you would tear open the heavens and come down,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;so that the mountains would quake at your presence-&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From ages past no one has heard,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no ear has perceived,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no eye has seen any God besides you,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;who works for those who wait for him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have all become like one who is unclean,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We all fade like a leaf,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone from the crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak; and whenever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so&amp;hellip;.It has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are able! All things can be done for the one who believes.&amp;rdquo; Immediately the father of the child cried out, &amp;ldquo;I believe; help my unbelief!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Mark 9:17-18, 22-24&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength&amp;hellip;. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is the way; walk in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Isaiah 30:15, 19-21&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good.&lt;/strong&gt; -Genesis 1:31&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my all-time favorite poems is William Carlos Williams&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The Red Wheelbarrow&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so much depends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;upon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a red wheel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;barrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;glazed with rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beside the white&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chickens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My high school students in Houston had no idea why I would like such an odd little poem. This was my attempt at an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10. God, I Need to Confront Someone</title>
      <link>https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/10.-god-i-need-to-confront-someone/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one&amp;rsquo;s foes will be members of one&amp;rsquo;s own household.&lt;/strong&gt; -Matthew 10:34-36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Christian, I am called to win over hearts and minds to Christ. But I am more often called to do so with gentle cajoling than with angry confrontation. There are two major problems with confrontation. First, if I am honest with myself, I will see that my confrontation is often rooted in my own anger rather than in Christian love. Second, in the promotion of Christian values and ideals, confrontation is often an ineffective tool. It causes the person being confronted to be defensive of the status quo rather than open to new ideas or new ways of life. If, however, I couch my words in unconditional love and acceptance, then that person will feel less threatened by the challenge to change. The old adage is true: I can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the LORD, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you. When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart, I will let you find me, says the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.&lt;/strong&gt; -Jeremiah 29:11-14&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;strong&gt;that I know very well.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My frame was not hidden from you,&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;all the days that were formed for me,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when none of them as yet existed.&lt;/strong&gt;
-Psalm 139:14-16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lazy summer day a couple of years ago, I was playing with my nephews, Cameron and Dillon. They were taking turns doing tricks on Cameron&amp;rsquo;s new scooter. It looked easy to ride (famous last words), so I said, &amp;ldquo;Let me give it a try.&amp;rdquo; It took about twenty seconds for me to flip over the thing, careening into the mud. Afterward, I noticed that I had a fairly large cut on my leg from my wipeout. I cleaned it up and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cain said to his brother Abel, &amp;ldquo;Let us go out to the field.&amp;rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then the LORD said to Cain, &amp;ldquo;Where is your brother Abel?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?&amp;rdquo; And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;What have you done?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, &amp;ldquo;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!&amp;rdquo; In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.&amp;rdquo; Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o&amp;rsquo;clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&amp;rdquo; which means, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&amp;rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.&lt;/strong&gt; (Luke 9:51-55)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; - John 20:19-22&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;..to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.&amp;rdquo; So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 Corinthians 12:7-9&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, &amp;ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.&amp;rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I&amp;rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life. I might be filled with joy returning from a family camping trip, or I might be seething with anger about an argument I&amp;rsquo;ve just had with my best friend. I might have my dying grandmother in mind, or I simply might want to relax in the stillness of the evening. Often I have a strong sense that God is calling me to bring this mood or situation to our quiet time together. But often, I feel the need for a customized &amp;ldquo;prayer starter&amp;rdquo;: a Bible passage that deals with my current mood, a short reflection I can use to begin my conversation with God, a concrete suggestion about how to pray in this particular situation or a pithy quote I can easily memorize and carry with me as I exit my prayer and enter my day. Sitting in my prayer chair with coffee mug in hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself thinking, &amp;ldquo;I wish I had a book in which I could look up the mood I&amp;rsquo;m in today to get me started on my prayer.&amp;rdquo; Searching long and hard for such a book and not finding one, I decided that I ought to take Langford&amp;rsquo;s advice and write one myself. God, I Have Issues is not intended to be read from cover to cover. It is a reference manual to help you bring the stuff of your life into your daily prayer time. The concept is simple: using the various indexes in the back of the book, find the entry that best fits your situation or mood. You can read the entire entry in the first few minutes of your prayer time and plan your prayer accordingly, meditating on one of the suggested Scriptures, pondering the reflection or trying out one of the prayer pointers. In the days that follow, you can use the &amp;ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages&amp;rdquo; section to continue your reflections. If you&amp;rsquo;re still needing more, or if this entry does not quite fit your particular situation, you can check out the suggestions from the &amp;ldquo;Related Entries&amp;rdquo; section. Finally, you can memorize or scribble down a quote from the &amp;ldquo;Words to Take with You&amp;rdquo; section so that you can return to prayer at quiet moments in your day. Some of the quotes are profound and thought provoking, some are just downright silly. But I hope you will find them to be a helpful way of bringing you back to the reflective state of your earlier prayer time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
