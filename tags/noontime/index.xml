&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>
