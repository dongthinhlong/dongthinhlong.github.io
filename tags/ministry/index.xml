&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, &amp;ldquo;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!&amp;rdquo; In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.&amp;rdquo; Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o&amp;rsquo;clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&amp;rdquo; which means, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
-Mark 15:29-34&lt;/p&gt;</description>
