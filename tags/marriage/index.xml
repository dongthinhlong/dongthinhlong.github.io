      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cain said to his brother Abel, &amp;ldquo;Let us go out to the field.&amp;rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then the LORD said to Cain, &amp;ldquo;Where is your brother Abel?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?&amp;rdquo; And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;What have you done? Listen; your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying out to me from the ground&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Genesis 4:8-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&amp;rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.&lt;/strong&gt; (Luke 9:51-55)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
