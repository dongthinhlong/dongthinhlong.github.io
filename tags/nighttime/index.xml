&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; - John 20:19-22&lt;/p&gt;</description>
