&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O, that you would tear open the heavens and come down,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;so that the mountains would quake at your presence-&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From ages past no one has heard,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no ear has perceived,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no eye has seen any God besides you,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;who works for those who wait for him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have all become like one who is unclean,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We all fade like a leaf,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&lt;/strong&gt;
-Isaiah 64:1, 3-4, 6-7&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone from the crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak; and whenever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so&amp;hellip;.It has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are able! All things can be done for the one who believes.&amp;rdquo; Immediately the father of the child cried out, &amp;ldquo;I believe; help my unbelief!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Mark 9:17-18, 22-24&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength&amp;hellip;. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is the way; walk in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Isaiah 30:15, 19-21&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the LORD, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you. When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart, I will let you find me, says the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.&lt;/strong&gt; -Jeremiah 29:11-14&lt;/p&gt;</description>
