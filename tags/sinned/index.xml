      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cain said to his brother Abel, &amp;ldquo;Let us go out to the field.&amp;rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then the LORD said to Cain, &amp;ldquo;Where is your brother Abel?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?&amp;rdquo; And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;What have you done? Listen; your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying out to me from the ground&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Genesis 4:8-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;..to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.&amp;rdquo; So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 Corinthians 12:7-9&lt;/p&gt;</description>
