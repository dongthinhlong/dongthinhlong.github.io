&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wonderful are your works;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that I know very well.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My frame was not hidden from you,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when I was being made in secret,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;intricately woven in the depths of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your eyes beheld my unformed substance.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In your book were written&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;all the days that were formed for me,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when none of them as yet existed.&lt;/strong&gt;
-Psalm 139:14-16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lazy summer day a couple of years ago, I was playing with my nephews, Cameron and Dillon. They were taking turns doing tricks on Cameron&amp;rsquo;s new scooter. It looked easy to ride (famous last words), so I said, &amp;ldquo;Let me give it a try.&amp;rdquo; It took about twenty seconds for me to flip over the thing, careening into the mud. Afterward, I noticed that I had a fairly large cut on my leg from my wipeout. I cleaned it up and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;..to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.&amp;rdquo; So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 Corinthians 12:7-9&lt;/p&gt;</description>
