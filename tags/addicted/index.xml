&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>
