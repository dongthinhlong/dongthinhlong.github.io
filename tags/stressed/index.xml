&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>
