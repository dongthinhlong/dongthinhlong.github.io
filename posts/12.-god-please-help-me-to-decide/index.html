Here are some helpful tips about discernment from my favorite saint, Ignatius Loyola:\nWhen in desolation, I should not make any big decisions. When I am depressed or in a foul mood, my objectivity goes out the window. Therefore, it is better for me to stick with prior commitments until I feel better.\nI should pray for Ignatian indifference. “Ignatian indifference” refers to a state of mind wherein I am completely open to doing whatever God wants me to do. I need to pray for this grace before I begin to make my decision. Otherwise, I’ll really be justifying my own wishes by saying, “I prayed about it.”\nAt the beginning of the discernment, I must remember the end for which I am striving. I should write out a personal mission statement at the beginning of the discernment process so that I don’t confuse the end with the various means to that end.\nThe option that looks holier may not actually be holier. Jesus says that the devil comes as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. For example, the evil spirit may convince a battered wife that it is God’s will to stay with this dangerous man.\nThe spirit of peace is usually a sign of God’s will. In prayer I should imagine each of my options played out. Then I should observe which option brings me more peace when I dream about it. That peace may be God’s way of telling me to go in that direction.\nAt the end of my life, which way would I like to look back upon? In prayer I should imagine myself on my deathbed or up in heaven playing the videotape of my life in front of God. What would I want God to see on that tape?\nOnce I think I have my answer, I should await confirmation from God. Even after I’ve come to a decision, I should place that decision before God several times, asking him to confirm that it is the right one.\nI need a spiritual guide. I should keep sharing my discernment process with a wise and holy person. Ignatius says that the devil likes for me to keep secrets.\nOnce the process is over, I should boldly act according to the fruits of my discernment. I should turn over this decision to God and not let the future frighten me.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES DEUTERONOMY 30:11-20: I have set before you life and death-choose life\n1 KINGS 3:1-15: Give me wisdom to judge right from wrong\nWISDOM 9:1-11: Give me wisdom that sits by your throne\nSIRACH 14:20-27: Happy the one who meditates on wisdom\nISAIAH 30:15-21: By waiting you shall be told, “This is the way; walk in it.”\nJEREMIAH 29:11-14: I know well the plans I have for you, plans of fullness\nJEREMIAH 31:31-34: Deep within I will write my law\nMATTHEW 7: On prayer and discernment\nMARK 10:46-52: The blind man Bartimaeus: “I want to see!”\nEPHESIANS 5:8-21: Try to discern the will of the Lord\n1 JOHN 4: Test the spirits to see whether they are from God\nPRAYER POINTERS Before praying about my options, I ask God to give me the grace of Ignatian indifference, a state of being wherein I am completely open to whatever it is God wants of me. If I am in that state, I allow myself some time to feel the power and the freedom of this grace.\nIn prayer I write out a personal mission statement. I ask myself, “What is the end for which I strive?” I spend some time on this, knowing that until I’m clear about this, I will be tempted to confuse the end with the various means.\nIn my prayerful imagination, I play out my life as it would go if I chose Option A; then I play out my life as if I chose Option B, and so on. While playing these options out, I observe which one brings peace in my heart. Saint Ignatius Loyola says that this is usually the clearest sign of God’s will.\nOnce I think I’ve arrived at an answer, I spend more time in prayer asking God for confirmation of that choice. In other words, I ask God to let me know somehow that this choice, indeed, is God’s will.\nOnce I have come to my decision, I don’t look back. I turn it over to God, knowing that the Lord will make good come from the situation regardless of my actions. I trust that he will do so.\nRELATED ENTRIES Change, Lost, Procrastinator\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU Man is created to praise, reverence and serve God our Lord, and by this means to save his soul….
