The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. He said to them, &ldquo;Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.&rdquo; For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. -Mark 6:30-32
I really love the scene from the Bible passage above. Earlier, Jesus had sent the apostles off on their first mission by themselves. And things went well, very well. The apostles have returned, exhausted but thrilled with all of the wonders God worked through them. They can&rsquo;t contain their joy, and all of them are talking at the same time as they tell Jesus all about their adventures. Jesus is smiling a paternal smile. He&rsquo;s very proud and happy. &ldquo;Come by yourselves to an out-of-the-way place,&rdquo; he says. I can imagine the intimacy shared between them in this scene and the bond that now exists because of the accomplishment of common mission. The story in Mark goes on to say that the people loved them so much that they ran ahead to the not-so-hidden hiding place and were waiting for the apostles when they arrived. But at the very least, Jesus and the apostles had that quiet boat ride in the sunset. I can easily picture them drifting along on the placid waters, in no hurry to get any place. Three of them have fallen asleep. Peter can&rsquo;t resist putting a fishing line in the water. Matthew hates being on the water and sits in the middle of the boat, nervously telling the others not to rock it too much. James and John are teasing him about this and are rocking the boat even more, which makes Jesus laugh out loud. And all the while, despite their exhaustion, they can&rsquo;t help telling each other stories about all the ways God worked through their hands and feet and words and actions. They are drunk on joy."><meta name=author content="dongthinhlong"><link rel=canonical href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/17.-god-its-evening/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=vi href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/17.-god-its-evening/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/17.-god-its-evening/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="@dongthinhlong"><meta property="og:title" content="17.

They are drunk on joy.\nI can easily imagine this scene because I’ve had many similar evenings with Jesus and our mutual friends. There is no greater feeling than to “come away” to dinnertime with friends or family at the end of a long and productive day. I’ve sat on many a porch or patio on such an evening and allowed the cicadas and fireflies to lull me into a quieter state. Watching the sun begin to droop sleepily, it seems the whole world is peaceful and content. A friend of mine was fond of saying, “Even the hands of the clock are resting-just hanging there at 6:30 in the evening.” And always Jesus is there, sleepily sitting next to me on the swing. Together, without even trying and sometimes not even conscious of it, we praise the Father who blessed our labor of the day and who blesses the peace and stillness of this evening.\nSun and moon, bless the Lord…\nStars of heaven, bless the Lord.\n-Daniel 3:62, 63 (NAB)\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES PSALM 46:9-12: Be still and know I am God\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nMATTHEW 11:25-30: Come to me, you who are weary\nMARK 6:30-33: Come away awhile\nLUKE 5:15-16: Jesus would often slip away to pray\nLUKE 10:17-24: The disciples return home rejoicing\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha and Mary\nLUKE 12:1-12: When they bring you before the authorities\nLUKE 24:13-35: Were not our hearts burning within us?\nPRAYER POINTERS I sit quietly in the evening after a long and productive day. I allow myself to relax and enjoy the stillness of the evening as images of the day peacefully drift by. I do not use this time to plan for tomorrow or to critique my recent actions. I just let the world drift by for a few minutes and enjoy the ride that is my life.\nI imagine Jesus sitting next to me enjoying the leisurely nature of the evening. I say nothing to him and he says nothing to me. We just sit there and enjoy each other’s company.\nI thank God for my good-if not perfect-life.\nRELATED ENTRIES Awe, Content, Grateful, Joyful, Ministry, Proud, Still and Quiet\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU It is the time wasted with your rose that makes your rose so important.\n-Antoine de Saint-Exupery\nWithout soul, where would a man go?\n-“Jack,” graffiti on the wall at Robert’s Bar, New Orleans\n","wordCount":"742","inLanguage":"vi","datePublished":"2024-09-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dongthinhlong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/17.-god-its-evening/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"@dongthinhlong","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/ accesskey=h title="@dongthinhlong (Alt + H)">@dongthinhlong</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
