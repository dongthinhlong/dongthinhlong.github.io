Sometimes I’m called by God to shake people out of their traditional way of thinking or acting. I must be the one to stop the speeding train from careening over a cliff, and the only way to do so is to crash into it head-on myself. As a teacher, a parent, a friend, a leader, a citizen, a church member, I am sometimes called to stand up and turn over the tables of the moneychangers. The only good motive for ever doing so is love. I decide that the most loving thing that I can do at this moment is to destroy the comfortable godless world in which people are dwelling.\nBut those times are rare. Most of the time when I blow up, it’s because I’ve lost control of my own passions, and I explode like an erupted pressure cooker. Why do people explode in anger? A friend of mine who is active in Alcoholics Anonymous taught me the H.A.L.T. formula. She said, “When you’re about to blow up and do something stupid, you’ve got to H.A.L.T. and ask yourself, ‘Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired?’ Once you’ve determined which of these four is the problem, you can work on fixing that relatively simple need rather than losing control and behaving destructively.”\nFrom another perspective, science tells us that every species of animal in the world generally reacts to perceived threats in one of two ways: fight or flight. When I’m courageous enough to pray about my outbursts of anger, I often discover that the motive behind the outburst was not love at all but rather some unacknowledged fear deep inside me. Often, when I explode, it’s because, far below the level of consciousness, I feel terribly threatened, and I am desperately trying to save myself.\nShould this be the case, then, in my prayer, as I look back on my outburst, I must courageously allow Jesus to ask me, “What did you feel threatened by?” That’s a tough question to face. If I exploded emotionally, it’s probably because of a deep-seated pain. It will not reveal its frightened self easily. I will have to approach it gingerly, carefully, slowly. I must beg God to give me the strength and the courage to face this wound with integrity and humility. Once I’ve confronted my threatened self, I can then ask Christ to begin the slow process of healing me. On a practical level, I can seek ways to feel more secure in similar situations.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 4:1-15: Cain kills Abel\nPSALM 103: The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love\nPSALM 131: O Lord, my soul is still\nPROVERBS 14:17: A quick tempered man does foolish things\nISAIAH 2:2-5: They shall beat their swords into plowshares\nMATTHEW 5:21-26: Everyone who grows angry shall be liable to judgment\nMATTHEW 5:38-43: Love your enemies\nMATTHEW 21:18-22: Jesus curses the fig tree\nMATTHEW 26:47-56: The one who lives by the sword shall die by the sword\nMARK 11:15-19: Jesus cleanses the temple\nLUKE 9:51-56: Jesus chides the apostles about their revenge\nJOHN 2:13-25: Jesus and the moneychangers\nACTS 15: Paul and Barnabas fight and split\nROMANS 12:17-21: “Vengeance is mine,” says the Lord\nEPHESIANS 4:25-32: Do not let the sun go down on your anger\nJAMES 3: No one can tame the tongue-a restless evil, full of poison\nPRAYER POINTERS As painful as it is to do so, I pray for those who hurt me and for those whom I have hurt. I ask the Lord to bless these people with his abundant love and grace.\nIf I have blown up recently, it would be good for me to practice stillness in my prayer. I should ask the Lord for the grace of inner peace. Praying over Psalm 131 or using a mantra such as “Still me, O Lord” might help.\nSometimes I discover in my prayer that I feel threatened by a particular person. In my journal, I write him or her a letter that I never intend to send. That way, I can be uncensored in laying down my own vulnerability and fear. The purpose of this letter is not to reconcile with the person, but rather to get in touch with my own fear. By addressing the letter to the person whom I fear, I am beginning the slow process of facing him or her. After I have written the letter, I should read it aloud to Jesus and ask him for consolation and healing. Only then can Jesus and I begin to discern how to reconcile with that person.\nAfter praying over the question, “What am I threatened by?”, I might also explore the following questions: “Would it be appropriate for me to attempt to reconcile with those I may have hurt? If so, how? Am I ready to forgive myself for losing it? Do those I’ve hurt know that I love them?
