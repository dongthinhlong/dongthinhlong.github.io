&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O, that you would tear open the heavens and come down,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;so that the mountains would quake at your presence-&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From ages past no one has heard,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no ear has perceived,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;no eye has seen any God besides you,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;who works for those who wait for him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have all become like one who is unclean,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We all fade like a leaf,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&lt;/strong&gt;
-Isaiah 64:1, 3-4, 6-7&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone from the crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak; and whenever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so&amp;hellip;.It has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are able! All things can be done for the one who believes.&amp;rdquo; Immediately the father of the child cried out, &amp;ldquo;I believe; help my unbelief!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Mark 9:17-18, 22-24&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 22:40-44&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength&amp;hellip;. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is the way; walk in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Isaiah 30:15, 19-21&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good.&lt;/strong&gt; -Genesis 1:31&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my all-time favorite poems is William Carlos Williams&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The Red Wheelbarrow&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so much depends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;upon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a red wheel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;barrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;glazed with rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beside the white&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chickens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My high school students in Houston had no idea why I would like such an odd little poem. This was my attempt at an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10. God, I Need to Confront Someone</title>
      <link>https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/10.-god-i-need-to-confront-someone/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one&amp;rsquo;s foes will be members of one&amp;rsquo;s own household.&lt;/strong&gt; -Matthew 10:34-36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Christian, I am called to win over hearts and minds to Christ. But I am more often called to do so with gentle cajoling than with angry confrontation. There are two major problems with confrontation. First, if I am honest with myself, I will see that my confrontation is often rooted in my own anger rather than in Christian love. Second, in the promotion of Christian values and ideals, confrontation is often an ineffective tool. It causes the person being confronted to be defensive of the status quo rather than open to new ideas or new ways of life. If, however, I couch my words in unconditional love and acceptance, then that person will feel less threatened by the challenge to change. The old adage is true: I can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the LORD, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. Then when you call upon me and come and pray to me, I will hear you. When you search for me, you will find me; if you seek me with all your heart, I will let you find me, says the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.&lt;/strong&gt; -Jeremiah 29:11-14&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Someone gave a great dinner and invited many. At the time for the dinner he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, &amp;lsquo;Come; for everything is ready now.&amp;rsquo; But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &amp;lsquo;I have bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it; please accept my regrets.&amp;rsquo; Another said, &amp;lsquo;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please accept my regrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; -Luke 14:16-19&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wonderful are your works;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that I know very well.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My frame was not hidden from you,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when I was being made in secret,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;intricately woven in the depths of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your eyes beheld my unformed substance.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In your book were written&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;all the days that were formed for me,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when none of them as yet existed.&lt;/strong&gt;
-Psalm 139:14-16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lazy summer day a couple of years ago, I was playing with my nephews, Cameron and Dillon. They were taking turns doing tricks on Cameron&amp;rsquo;s new scooter. It looked easy to ride (famous last words), so I said, &amp;ldquo;Let me give it a try.&amp;rdquo; It took about twenty seconds for me to flip over the thing, careening into the mud. Afterward, I noticed that I had a fairly large cut on my leg from my wipeout. I cleaned it up and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cain said to his brother Abel, &amp;ldquo;Let us go out to the field.&amp;rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then the LORD said to Cain, &amp;ldquo;Where is your brother Abel?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper?&amp;rdquo; And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;What have you done? Listen; your brother&amp;rsquo;s blood is crying out to me from the ground&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frost and chill, bless the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;
Daniel 3:69 (NAB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praised be you, my Lord, with all your creatures, especially Sir Brother Sun, Who is the day and through whom you give us light. And he is beautiful and radiant with great splendor&amp;hellip;.&lt;/strong&gt;
Saint Francis of Assisi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the course of a lifetime experiences rare and wonderful epiphanies in nature when God momentarily lifts the veil of our unknowing and shows us his face. Here&amp;rsquo;s one of mine:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, &amp;ldquo;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!&amp;rdquo; In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.&amp;rdquo; Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o&amp;rsquo;clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&amp;rdquo; which means, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&amp;rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.&lt;/strong&gt; (Luke 9:51-55)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; - John 20:19-22&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;..to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, &amp;ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.&amp;rdquo; So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 Corinthians 12:7-9&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to a group of aspiring writers, author and editor Jeremy Langford once said, &amp;ldquo;Write the book that you want to read.&amp;rdquo; Very often as I settle down to pray, I&amp;rsquo;m preoccupied by a particular mood or situation in my life. I might be filled with joy returning from a family camping trip, or I might be seething with anger about an argument I&amp;rsquo;ve just had with my best friend. I might have my dying grandmother in mind, or I simply might want to relax in the stillness of the evening. Often I have a strong sense that God is calling me to bring this mood or situation to our quiet time together. But often, I feel the need for a customized &amp;ldquo;prayer starter&amp;rdquo;: a Bible passage that deals with my current mood, a short reflection I can use to begin my conversation with God, a concrete suggestion about how to pray in this particular situation or a pithy quote I can easily memorize and carry with me as I exit my prayer and enter my day. Sitting in my prayer chair with coffee mug in hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself thinking, &amp;ldquo;I wish I had a book in which I could look up the mood I&amp;rsquo;m in today to get me started on my prayer.&amp;rdquo; Searching long and hard for such a book and not finding one, I decided that I ought to take Langford&amp;rsquo;s advice and write one myself. God, I Have Issues is not intended to be read from cover to cover. It is a reference manual to help you bring the stuff of your life into your daily prayer time. The concept is simple: using the various indexes in the back of the book, find the entry that best fits your situation or mood. You can read the entire entry in the first few minutes of your prayer time and plan your prayer accordingly, meditating on one of the suggested Scriptures, pondering the reflection or trying out one of the prayer pointers. In the days that follow, you can use the &amp;ldquo;Suggested Scripture Passages&amp;rdquo; section to continue your reflections. If you&amp;rsquo;re still needing more, or if this entry does not quite fit your particular situation, you can check out the suggestions from the &amp;ldquo;Related Entries&amp;rdquo; section. Finally, you can memorize or scribble down a quote from the &amp;ldquo;Words to Take with You&amp;rdquo; section so that you can return to prayer at quiet moments in your day. Some of the quotes are profound and thought provoking, some are just downright silly. But I hope you will find them to be a helpful way of bringing you back to the reflective state of your earlier prayer time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
