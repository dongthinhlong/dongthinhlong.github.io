This was my attempt at an explanation:\nNot very often, but every now and then, a person gets a moment of epiphany, a moment when every little tiny thing in the world seems just right and nothing, nothing seems out of place. The thing about those moments is that they usually occur at the most ordinary times. Reading this poem, I imagine Williams sitting on a porch somewhere in the country with a cup of coffee, a pencil and a blank sheet of paper beside him. In my imagination Williams has had writer’s block for several days and is frustrated and angry about his complete lack of creativity. Then all of a sudden, for just a moment, while looking across the yard at the wheelbarrow and the chickens, he felt completely and utterly happy. The moment passed-but nothing was ever the same again.\nYears ago, during the time I was teaching high school in Dallas, I wrote the following in my prayer journal:\nI woke up on Saturday, showered, dressed and was pouring a cup of coffee in my travel mug, preparing to drive to a wrestling meet when the thought came to me, “I could do this for a long, long time.” The “this” in that statement was not only high school teaching but also Dallas, this community, this wrestling chaplaincy, this coffee mug- everything.\nAlthough that moment occurred over eight years ago, I still remember every detail of it. I remember the grogginess in my head, the smell of the strong New Orleans coffee, the comforting feel of the twenty-year-old “Jesuit” sweatshirt I was wearing. And, like Williams, I remember feeling completely happy.\nA few years later I had to leave high school teaching for four years of graduate school in Boston. But throughout this time, I kept remembering that moment with the sweatshirt and the coffee mug. And when asked by my superiors what I might like to do after grad school, my answer came easily. “I’d like to go back to high school work,” I said. And today, here I am, plowing through American Literature with all of you. And I am perfectly happy.\nAnd it was all because of that moment.\nso much depends\nupon\nthe weather-beaten\nsweatshirt\nbeside the white plastic\ncoffee mug\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES GENESIS 1-2: The creation stories\nЈов 42:10-17: The Lord restores Job’s prosperity\nPSALM 116: What return shall I make for the good he has done for me?\nDANIEL 3:52-90: All things bless the Lord\nMATTHEW 5:1-12: The beatitudes\nMATTHEW 6:25-34: Consider the lilies\nLUKE 10:38-42: Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things\nPHILIPPIANS 4:4-13: I have learned to cope in every circumstance\nPRAYER POINTERS Ignatius speaks of an experience he calls “consolation without previous cause.” He says that at times God will grant me the experience of complete peace and contentedness.

Despite all of this, I feel cockeyed with joy! Ignatius says that this is one of the most grace-filled experiences one will have in this life and that one should not analyze or scrutinize it, but rather one should simply bask in its warmth and comfort. In my prayer then, I should not try to figure out why it is that I’m so happy right now. Instead, I simply sing God’s praises and enjoy the gift of happiness.\nI should take advantage of this joyous moment by responding in generosity to God’s goodness.
