Mark Thibodeaux, S.J., begins the “God, I’m Afraid” entry by referencing the disciples locked away in fear after the crucifixion, when Jesus appears and says, “Peace be with you” (John 20:19–22). This story sets the stage for facing our fears with Jesus at our side.\nReflection:\nPrayer becomes a tool for digging deeper beyond surface-level fears. Suppose you are afraid to speak out against an injustice at work. Thibodeaux suggests asking yourself: “What am I really afraid of?” Is it rejection, conflict, or something deeper such as a childhood memory being triggered? Each time you pray, return to this question, seeking a deeper understanding of your fear. Eventually, you may uncover a core issue that underlies the anxiety, like the dread of being perceived as an inadequate parent or provider.\nThe next, and often more challenging, step is to invite Jesus into that “locked room”—the most frightening part of yourself. Thibodeaux shares the story of a friend, Paul, who, in prayer, envisioned himself and Jesus walking through the rooms of his house (his inner life). When they approached the locked room representing his deepest fears, Paul initially refused to let Jesus enter. After several prayer sessions, he finally allowed Jesus in, discovering liberation and healing.\nThibodeaux encourages us to do the same: take Jesus by the hand and enter the “dark, cobwebbed room” of our fear, allowing Jesus to illuminate it. In the light, we often realize the fear is less formidable than we imagined.\nSuggested Scripture Passages:\n1 Samuel 17:32–51 (David and Goliath) Psalm 23 (“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want”) Isaiah 41:1–10 (“Fear not, for I am with you”) Matthew 14:22–33 (Jesus rescues the apostles from the stormy sea) John 20:19–23 (Jesus says, “Peace be with you”) Romans 8:28–39 (All things work together for good)\n(Full list provided in the book.) Prayer Pointers:\nAllow yourself, with Jesus, to probe the roots of your fear. Write out detailed descriptions of your fears at each level. Imagine these fears as rooms within rooms. In each, picture Jesus sitting with you, lighting a candle, and inviting you to discuss what you see. Related Entries:\nConfront, Nighttime, Worried\nWords to Take With You:\nI know that God will not give me anything that I can’t handle. I just wish he didn’t trust me so much.\n—Mother Teresa of Calcutta\nThis approach reframes fear not as a failing, but as an invitation to deeper self-knowledge and intimacy with God, who enters even our most hidden places to bring peace[2].\n","wordCount":"444","inLanguage":"vi","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dongthinhlong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/posts/2.-god-im-afraid/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"@dongthinhlong","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dongthinhlong.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dongthinhlong.github.io/ accesskey=h title="@dongthinhlong (Alt + H)">@dongthinhlong</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
