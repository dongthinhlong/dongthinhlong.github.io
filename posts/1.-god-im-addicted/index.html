They provide the impetus I need to finally surrender my life to God. My addiction is “exhibit A” among my proofs for why I can’t manage the job of being my own savior. I have many other proofs, but this one is the most convincing. Without my addiction, I could almost convince myself that I don’t need a savior. But try as I might, no matter what I do, no matter how many degrees I get, or how many friends I have, or how many promises I make, or how many times a day I pray, I cannot get a handle on my addiction. I am powerless over it. I will need a higher power to rescue me from it.\nSome of the happiest, healthiest, holiest people I know are alcoholics who speak freely of their addiction. It is as though they have found some sort of freedom in being able to say, “I give up. I can’t handle it, and I won’t fight it anymore. I’m an alcoholic: I am powerless in the face of alcohol.” I can’t imagine the relief one must feel in being able to finally let go of the battles and ask Christ to be one’s champion. Many will even go so far as to say that they are grateful for their addiction, for it was through it that they found God and even found themselves. Sounds a lot like Saint Paul, doesn’t it?\nI will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. (2 Corinthians 12:9)\nEvery one of us is an addict. Every one of us clings too tightly to one thing or another. If we’re not careful, our addictions will destroy us. They may flatten us quickly, or they may corrode our lives little by little, leaving us impotent and lifeless. That is, of course, if we choose not to use our addictions to lead us to the altar of Christ-the place where we Christians celebrate the broken body of our Lord. It is in that brokenness that we are made whole.\nSUGGESTED SCRIPTURE PASSAGES EXODUS 32: The golden calf NUMBERS 11: Complaining in the desert JUDGES 16:4-31: Samson’s lust destroys him 1 KINGS 11: Solomon turns his heart to other gods EZEKIEL 37:1-14: God restores dry bones JOEL 2:15-3:2: Call to penance; the Lord responds MATTHEW 17:14-21: Casting out demons MATTHEW 19:16-30: The rich young man MARK 5:1-20: The healing of the demoniac MARK 5:21-43: Fear is useless-what is needed is faith MARK 10:46-52: The blind man Bartimaeus LUKE 12:13-21: Storing up earthly treasure LUKE 23:39-43: Jesus saves the good thief JOHN 4:1-39: The woman at the well JOHN 8:1-11: The woman being stoned JOHN 8:31-36: The truth will set you free ROMANS 7:14-25: What I want to do, I do not do 2 CORINTHIANS 4:7-18: We are afflicted but not crushed 2 CORINTHIANS 12:7-10: My grace is sufficient for you\nPRAYER POINTERS If I have not already done so, I pray over the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (see www.aa.org). I spend a great deal of time reflecting on my powerlessness in the face of my addiction. I beg God to take over my life- to be my savior. I ask God, “Of these twelve steps, which do I need to work on the most right now?” God and I have a conversation about this.\nI prayerfully search for one person with whom I can share my troubles. I consider well who would be the most helpful to me. I imagine myself telling this person absolutely everything about my addiction, and I imagine how this person might respond. I consider committing myself to actually approaching this person about it.\nRELATED ENTRIES Habits, Hate, Guilty, Lust, Sinned\nWORDS TO TAKE WITH YOU A sick dog always returns to his vomit.\nProverbs 26:11 (paraphrased) Worms become butterflies.\nAnonymous God did not invite the Children of Israel to leave the slavery\nof Egypt: he commanded them to do so.\nThomas Merton The truth has many enemies.
